Thank you! I feel that I probably can’t take credit for it, as I’m sure I picked it up from someone else. I want to say that I don’t understand why it’s so hard for humans to recognize ‘other’ humans as such, but I actually do because I studied it for years and at a formative time. I wish everyone had a similar education to what I had. I feel as though I sprinkle bits and pieces of that information to people who I cross paths with. I live by what I’ve learned, and I suppose that’s the best I can do. Like I said, I’m glad to see that you share a similar understanding of humans! I would agree it’s probably easier said than done. I know there are a number of choices I’ve made in my life where even with my lessons I’ve folded to certain "tests." You put that last bit beautifully about making the more "evolved choice." I do think it comes down to that! I don’t think anyone has ever said evolution is easy. It doesn’t seem like an easy process. My personal evolution hasn’t been easy and continues to be painful at times! 

Yes, it’s really a must! It seems you know how important it is to be selective with who you keep beside you in your life. Or rather it seems life has made you that way. I’ve only just been learning that. There’s some saying about how "you are your friends" or something, and I’ve found there’s some truth to that! 

Something that pains me day in and day out is I actually generally understand even the people who have warped opinions and act destructively towards others. I know generally what has influenced them, and why they’re acting that way. Something that’s super interesting is that many of these people who persecute others are doing so because the people that they are singling out have some characteristic or similarity that is similar/the same and they are not at peace with it. It’s like a part of them that they haven’t learned how to integrate and instead of love, they hate. 
Again, here at the end you’ve put something in a wonderful way, and all I can say is that I share a similar view. 

I can see that about you now. I’m very much the same in who I surround myself with. 
I feel like I did read "On the Road" back in middle school, but it’s been so long I can’t remember much! I’ve heard the beginning of this quote quoted before! It’s a fantastic one! 
The "it takes one to know one" is stamped in my memory in permanent ink now! 
From all that I’ve learned I’ve come to believe that diversity is the most beautiful thing about humans and the thing that does make us unique amongst the other animals! All the other animals generally do the same things within a species,but we, we are so specific, and varied, and individual in our attributes and gifts! 
You also make me feel happy and warm and so much more! Your warmth and light comes through in your writing! I feel so special to see these sides of you that you share in writing and when we talk on the phone! 

I’m excited to hear stories about Glenny and Brittany! 

Zweeee! I’m buzzing for this dinner tech savvy futuro future date! I do have a computer! I’ve already messaged you about this by now, but Bright Eyes is playing here in Vegas on October 13! I would love to go to that with you! That’s a bittle bits away though. I definitely hope we don’t have to wait that long to see each other next! I’ll keep an eye out for other shows until then. I’ve only traveled once out of state to see one artist in my whole life. I’d absolutely be down to do so with you at some point! I am thinking that with switching my job up that if we want to see each other soon you might need to visit me here again…I’m not sure what you think about that? I visit this idea later in the letter, if you’d like to answer to that then. 

I talk about and with my mom all the time ahaha so I’m sure you’ll hear many things about her as we continue to learn about each other more! 
She’s definitely made a massive impact on who and how I am today. 
So I have 2 younger siblings, a 23 year old brother, and a 21 year old sister. They have a different father biologically. 
I guess it’s actually coined "Eldest daughter syndrome." It’s not a real diagnosis of course, it’s just something that’s an observable enough thing to be coined as a term. It is described as "the unique pressures and responsibilities that can be placed on the firstborn daughter in a family." 
It’s characterized by: Having a strong sense of responsibility, feeling a need for control, carrying the heavy weight of parents’ expectations, perfectionism, struggling with same-age relationships, feeling resentment towards family (parents or siblings), always putting others before themselves, trouble with enforcing or uphold boundaries, and people pleasing behaviors!😮‍💨
I had to take care of and set the example for my siblings a lot growing up and it led to the development of a lot of these things. I think I’ve also mentioned that I grew up fast and this is part of the reason why. I’ve struggled with every single one of those things throughout my life ahaha. As I’m getting older I’ve been able to recognize all of this and work on each of these things. 
Hearing that you’ve only ever seen your mom cry three times in your life makes me wonder if possibly that’s another possible reason you don’t cry! That’s wild! Five boys is also WILD! I can only imagine what she’s like! You need an abundance of energy to raise five kids in general, but all boys! It makes me tired just thinking about it! 
I could tell this about you from when we met, and as we’ve continued to talk. I really do feel honored that you deem me deserving to be let past your "guards." 
I wasn’t sure what was going on when we met, but I look back on that night and it’s interesting because at multiple junctures I had expressed being sad thinking that I had ‘missed’ you in some capacity. When I was checking out I mentioned to our doorman that I felt that I had missed out on you. And then I had missed your messages, but luckily as perhaps fate would have it-it wasn’t too late! 

Both of those things are intertwined and ever since that kind of content has become increasingly popular the men in the clubs are much more entitled/audacious, they spend less, and they almost seem to want to argue/debate with you. Overall it’s causing men to act narcissistically and mistreat girlies in the club. A lot of that content teaches young men in so many words that *they* are the prize and I don’t think that will ever be true. Yes I think men and women alike should know their worth and define that for themselves. I personally believe that women are and should always be regarded as the *prize* since we are the sacred portals to life. This kind of content reinforces patriarchy and is making some men try to be something that if they aren’t already (alphas) they don’t need to try to be. I truly believe not everyone can and should strive to be an "alpha" and this fixation is ridiculous. Again it’s another place where people are placing importance on a label. It would it be "too many cooks in the kitchen." We need diversity. I believe there’s someone for everyone. I wish people would stop giving a fuck about labels and start caring about how they treat one another! What people really need to stop doing with everything is shoving their agendas down people’s throats. Especially lost and vulnerable people because they’re easily manipulated. At the end of the day a lot of that content is doing well because it makes so much money. And it really has been affecting the behavior and money made in the clubs. I have one friend who is actually collecting & compiling "data" and experiences that girlies have been having throughout the past 2 years with this content being out n about! 

Thank you for such kind words! 
To that I would say mistreatment happens to all of us at some point. I think it’s one of those things where "they know not what they do" and on top of that, they know not *who* they do it to. You deserve so much more too! I’d like to be able to show you just how good someone can be treated my another person! I’m brainstorming all the ways! Eeep! I’m SO excited to hear you play guitar someday! 

I have a copy of it. I’ll give it to you when we see each other next! I actually started reading it while I was still with my ex when I think back! I finished it after the breakup. I know that it was part of what contributed to me finally being able to walk away! I think it undeniably makes a massive impact no matter when you read it. It’s a revolutionary read really! I did decide this year that it’s a must for a future partner to either read, let me read it to them, or have them listen to the audiobook. I’ve recommended it to countless friends and all of the ones who’ve read it say that it has also changed their lives for the better. 
You know in the last letter I almost wrote that I could *feel* those scars the night we went out to dinner. I’m not sure why I refrained from saying that. I suppose I wanted you to confirm that they were there. They didn’t scare me away then, and they don’t scare me now. They’re a part of your story. I wish I could kiss them. I think many people *dislike* themselves but to full on hate yourself and to do so for an extended period of time sounds like it’s own type of purgatory. That is a place I’m unsure of how many people go to. And to be able to leave that place with only scars! I do think that’s a special type of growth! I have no doubts that if I stick around I’ll see unprecedented growth in you. I plan on sticking around as long as you’ll let me, and if you falter in loving yourself I’ll remind you to do so! 

I think it’s funny that you perceive that I move quickly! With many things yes, but truly with some things I feel like it takes me forever. My mom says I really am "a little Aries ram that rams into things head first and has to bump my horns a couple of times before I learn" and she’s also says I’ve kind of always "learned the hard way." I’m also not beating the "spontaneous" allegations anytime soon. I’m glad you find me charming hehe! We are a bit like Tigger and Eeyore! That’s so cute! 

I mention outside of this "letter" that I made an oopsy and that suggestion is actually from a podcast with this top-dawg divorce attorney in NYC. That one is a podcast full of gems because despite seeing some of the nastiest separations he says he very much believes in love. He has many beautiful insights. I’ll share that one after you finish with this one with the couple. They might say something similar in their segment about conflict resolution. They actually do brush on an "aftercare" plan kind of! The attorney says "the worst time to learn how to fight is during a fight." 
I’ve also not been one for fighting or arguing, and in all of my past relationships the only arguments I’ve gotten in were about fidelity and accountability. 
I don’t feel boxed in by you saying that at all!
I have considered being a therapist, but I don’t know! I was thinking about going back to school possibly to study neuroscience and psychology perhaps. My little sister is actually in the neuroscience research field funnily enough! I don’t know! I’m pretty indecisive when it comes to what I want to do. I think my next focus is just physically where I want to move next. Then I’ll go from there. Environment really impacts me, and I have yet to find a place that feels like a good fit since Chicago. 

I’m not going to say it was okay, but I am mostly okay now. I don’t know if I believe any wound is ever truly healed all the way. I’m still putting together my beliefs around healing, but I think it’s definitely a journey. 
I learned so much! I wouldn’t undo anything I’ve done because of all the lessons I learned, the people I met because of the relationship, and the experiences I had! I know you’ve been there before. I strongly dislike hearing that you’ve had to go through that too! 
I’m just glad to be on the other side of all of that now! And I’m glad you are too! 

I can feel that through your writing too! Yeah I wouldn’t ask you to make any promises! I’m not sure if it’s good to ask anyone to promise you anything. I think the best promises are usually self proposed. I think again we’re on the same page with this. I wish we lived in the same state and at the same time I’m incredibly relieved you don’t live here actually! I also have been wondering to myself if we’d be getting to know each other in as much depth if we weren’t in the position we’re in now. I don’t know if we’d still be sharing letters. There’s no doubt in my mind that we’d make time for each other and talk endlessly in person, but all of *this* is so special and unique. It is feeling once in a lifetime. 
I’ve kept saying throughout the last 2 years here that I didn’t actually want to meet anyone local that I could seriously like because I don’t want any ties here. I don’t know if I’ve expressed to you that as soon as I can I’m gettin the hell up outta here. I feel as though I’ve just been sharpening up on what I like and dislike in dating here. And learning hard lessons of course too ahaha. 
I am also someone who does my best to not make promises I’m unsure of being able to keep and I do my best to keep my word as well. 

I like the way you put that and I think you’re spot on about Vegas. And yes Chicago is a home for sure. I would love spending summers there in the future still, and I love visiting. I will say I’m getting a bit burnt out on "big city" and "fast pace" living. I feel a part of me yearning for some place slower and smaller. That’s another reason why I wouldn’t go back there. 
I think I was meant and made for profound and hard lessons haha. Thank you for saying you think I’m taking them well! I’m just doing my best. Mmm I love this last line. I’m gonna keep that in mind! 

Oh no, I don’t take that in that way. I think though that I have been in some what felt like incredibly low places in the last year where I thought to myself, "I wish someone would save me" and then I would always think "the only person who can save you is you." I’ve definitely been gaining an abundance of experience and lessons. I mentioned at some point that I really think I was meant to come here and do all of this hard work and learning. I was made just strong enough for it I think. And I think it’s all leading to something fruitful. 
You are and I from the same camp in that regard. At the end of the day I think that’s what it’s like having a warriors heart. Yeah, I guess some people just look down on it for various reasons. That’s the thing that upsets me the most is that people think it’s taking the easy way out and in reality it’s a tough and dangerous path! You can be ostracized. You have no rights. You have to put a lot of trust into your own intuition about strangers. It definitely hasn’t been safe or easy. 
I’m beyond glad to know that you still respect me learning this about me! Makes me want to cry happy tears and it makes me like you even more! 

Same goes for you to me! We’ve said this in many different forms at this point, so it feels solidified for me now. I am likewise not perfect, but I plan to do the same for you. 

Mmmhmm! It was investigated because it resonated. I’m sure you’ve come to realize now that I’m quite a nerd, for lack of a better word.  I had seen it somewhere before and the general concept makes sense! I still need to dig deeper to reallly understand it. I don’t know if I asked you if you’re familiar with fractals? But I used to be pretty nerdy about those for a while!  They feel within a similar vein, but they’re not. 
Yeah, I guess I just want to see and know as much as I can about you. I find everything interesting about you! 
I don’t recall who says it, but someone says that "the way someone keeps their physical space is often a good representation of how their mind is" or something like that. From what I’ve observed both in myself and others, that seems to be true. I’m wanting to see your space because I think that might be another way I could "walk in your mind."
I’m down for this trade! Hehe show me yours and I’ll show you mine! 😜 This is true. You were here very briefly! 

Yeah, I think it’s possible to reach like a ‘baseline’ generally and then there’s always gonna be periods of winning, growth, or "upward movement" and then little dips down when life throws curveballs or lemons or wrenches! Thank you for holding that belief for me. I also believe that you deserve to feel those things too! 
Hmm I’m thinking about what a straightforward job looks like to me…I think the same as it does for everyone else. I was mostly in food service, serving, hostessing, bussing, cashiering, and a lil food prepping from 15 to 24. I did also do quite a bit of fundraising both door to door grassroots (bleghh) and for the Chicago Symphony orchestra and those were 9-5s. There were so many reasons I started dancing. One of them was I had pretty much been sexually harassed at every service job I ever had and then I wasn’t making enough I’m fundraising. So I got tired of all of that. It was all certainly more stable and safer than dancing has been. 

I was wondering! You didn’t tell me! Ahahaha you lil stalker you! That’s cute of you that you’ve watched it that much! I’m blushing! Eeep! I think I’m on my own timing and a unique journey. Or at least I tell myself that cause it makes me feel better. I’m continually putting trust in the process. 
Hehe yes! Zwee has come in black and could and should happen more in black! I’ve often felt there’s a mad, chaotic, and or dark aspect of Zwee that has yet to be explored and expounded upon.
I definitely think it’s possible to miss someone that you connect with in a particular way with that you also don’t fully know. For me there’s a feeling of that. 
I wish I was more spiritually attuned with some of my gifts or friends with someone at the moment who might be helpful in the realm of what that feeling is coming from. I do believe in past lives. In this lifetime I’ve only met a couple of people where we’ve both felt and acknowledged we think we’ve known each other in a past life or in another dimension, and a couple of those are good platonic friends to this day. Have you had connections with people who you’ve had that wondering about? I’m curious to hear what comes about after you explore this in journaling! 

How sweet of us! I really enjoy having you close and talking in my ears. It feels so intimate. It’s unique to you! I’m looking forward to when you’re able to talk close in my ears again. 

Wow, that’s really beautiful the way you put that! I’m at a loss for words, in a good way! The best way really! This is a first for me! I’ve planted some plans throughout this letter, I hope you can observe those seedlings for now. I plan to keep watering them. I can’t yet put into words the type of plan that I’d be satisfied in sharing. I will say I also plan on showing up in whatever capacity is required to nurture this relationship in whatever iteration it takes! I mention much earlier in the letter that because I’m changing jobs I think I’m anchored here in Vegas until I get something solidified. I’m extending an invitation to you to come visit me if you’d like to and for whenever that is possible for you.
