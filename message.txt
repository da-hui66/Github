I do indeed feel special at this point. I hope you do too! Wow! Maybe it’s a new awareness for you? Maybe you’ve not given it much thought? Or perhaps I really am the first in this lifetime? 
I’ve been hip to believing in the possibility of having connections with people from different dimensions or past lives for a while now. I’ve had a number of friends who do energy work, so I think I’ve had more exposure to certain possibilities. I have a couple of platonic friends that the connection feels that way. When people talk about "soul family" I think of them. 
I will say the magnetization that I’ve felt to you is unparalleled in my life! There’s so many "I couldn’t tell you whys but I just felt that I had to" for me about the night we met and in the time we had after that. I felt almost no anxiety about trusting you. I was glad that you asked if I thought that was possible. It’s funny to me because something that has bothered me is that various men this year had said "I miss you" after 1 date and even loftier things like "I miss your soul" and I would say, "You don’t KNOW me at all. You certainly don’t know my soul." I couldn’t feel their souls. They all got a very guarded version of me. I know that in the past year I had been sharpening my feeling to be indifferent with men no matter how handsome, or interesting, or cool, etc. they seemed and I was able to maintain that indifference easily. But with you something that shocks me is the emotional charge I had even from the night we met. I have been wondering that if we had "missed each other" in an even more pointed way that night we met I would still be thinking about you and wondering what could have been. 
With all that being said, I do feel that I miss you! 

I’ll be happy to see what grows too! I’m glad that you say that there is no rush. I mention earlier that of course I’d love to see you ASAP and at the same time I don’t feel the need for a rush. I trust that we will be able to be together in the flesh in good time. The wait is going to make it that much sweeter! I am itching to use the expression that I can’t wait to see you again! I certainly will of course! I’m absolutely buzzing with surges of yummy energy thinking about it! I want to spend time with you too. And I want to know you, deeply, as deeply as you’ll let me.
