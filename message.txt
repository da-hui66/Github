I’m glad you know that there’s no expectation in replying to my letters and vice versa. I inferred that Friday through Sunday is a different pace and schedule for you. You already know it is likewise a whole different vibe for me on weekends. And that I’m also hoping this will be the last weekend that I’m on this crazy club schedule! I have a feeling I might be transitioning to still maintaining one day at the club. I don’t think I’m gonna get to just rip this bandaid off. It’s going to be a slower transition out. 
I’m sure you’ve noticed by now that it also takes me longer to respond with a thoughtful and meaningful reply letter. I echo that it is not taxing to me either! It has become a treat for me to read and write a response! Your letter was definitely something that I enjoyed getting to read towards the end of my shift and when I got home!

You know I wonder about the impact, if any, of my high school has had on Albuquerque from time to time. I will say Albuquerque is already unique in that for as small of a city as it is, it is fairly diverse and there are a lot of "mixed" people, which makes for an interesting culture. There are a lot of people that have both "native" and "colonizer" within and they gotta heal from AND "repent" for their ancestors "sin" myself included in that. I think because of that and New Mexico having the most in tact "pueblos" and rez land a lot of the true history of America is shared around and acknowledged in the state already. I’m glad you’ve enjoyed hearing what I’ve had to share about this chapter of my life. I’m not sure how to respond to you thinking I have a "gift that makes people want to listen" to me. I’ve had one other person say this to me in my life and I just don’t know how to take it! I appreciate you saying it’s admirable that I take the time to share what I’ve learned. I don’t know if I think it’s admirable, but I will say that I hope I am helping make the world a better place when I share things, even if it is in a small way. 

Oh goodness! It feels like I am constantly being ‘tested’ out here. I can’t think of any smaller stories to share right now. There is one big and long story that comes to mind, and I’m not ready to share that one yet. I almost feel like it’s a story I need to tell you in person! One day I’ll get into that one! I was just thinking about that you mentioned that speech and still have to share it. I’m patiently awaiting when you find the version you’d like to share with me. I added David Foster Wallace to my notes on your idols after we talked the other day. Is that appropriate? I am certainly interested in reading what you recommend for after! I’m up for a 20 minute speech anytime! And the additional reading. Lay it on me! I’m looking forward to listening to and reading something that has had a profound impact on your life and who you are! 

Mmmm I like the way you put all of this about personal evolution and I find myself agreeing. I think that is the case for me. I’m a bit more prepared for what to expect with the next personal evolution. Being experienced helps in a way. 
Yeah, I think there’s actually a fair amount of research to back this up. A classic example is when men who get so riled up about gayness publicly are secretly incredibly gay, self loathing, and "closeted." They persecute people who are brave enough to live their truth because they are jealous among other things. Integrating shame is difficult. It seems to be one of those things where often when someone "points the finger" there are "two fingers pointing back." Some accusations are actually admissions sometimes! 
Yeah, I think that’s exactly what happens with the insecurity and self-dislike! 
From what it sounds like I’ve always been an empathic person, but my education and sitting with various plant medicines throughout the years has made me even more so! 
I personally believe in the oneness of all of us humans and all of Mother Gaia’s creatures and plants and everything, and I think that separateness is an illusion. I think in many ways what one person does to another they do in some ways do to themselves! 

I’m pretty sure I did read it, but I can’t be sure. There are books I read from that time that I don’t remember at all I *know* I read them! I’d love to read it soon! Or maybe have you read it to me?? Yes, I suppose I have multiple as I have books stacked in several places throughout my apartment. You actually pointed out a book from the stack on my nightstand called "Letting Go" at one point. I can’t remember why! I absolutely love the ideas of us reading a book together and of us reading to each other in any capacity! 

You hit something that I think is so important! "Cultural exchange" could change everything! I think there’s too much history of people destroying culture and imposing another culture! It makes me incredibly sad to think about all the lost culture. I have a heartwarming "cultural exchange" story for you when we talk on the phone next. I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on this topic! You’re taking the words right out of my mind with what you say about the ‘age of information’ and prejudice! I’ve not understood why people have such a conquering attitude around culture. 

Hehe zweeee! Yes, I’m so excited for this date! 
I am honored that you’re trying this "times adaption" to bring us closer. I find your ingenuity winsome! I too am rarely thankful for technology, but lately because of you I’ve been finding myself extra grateful for my phone! You let me know when is best for you and I’ll pen it in my calendar and count the days! 
I do so hope that you are able to move things around to be able to make the Bright Eyes show! I’m glad to hear how considerate you are of what is going on in my life. I’m doing my best to focus on myself, and l’m appreciative that you’re mature, understanding, and fostering of me to do so. It is a bit of a mental adjustment to think that for the first time in years I’m about to be less able to travel anytime I want! Funny timing you met me at that’s for sure considering the distance. I’ve not had someone say that to me in those words before! I mean the "what’s important to you, is important to me," thing. I feel that I will be able to transition my work lifestyle and still have the capacity to have you visit soon. I wish I knew when. Things seem to have a way of clicking in place in my life when I surrender/commit to a change. I certainly enjoy traveling and know that I would likely love to join you in traveling in the future! I’m excited to know that that’s something we have to look forward to! I’m trying to think about how to go about the having you travel here timeline. I feel like I won’t be able to say when is best to come because it’s uncertain what my schedule is going to look like. I’m finding that annoying, but I’m trying to remember to stay patient. Of course I’d love to see you ASAP really, but I also feel that there’s no rush. I have a strong feeling that you and I are going to know each for a long time. I’d like to reiterate that I feel like practicing patience for you. I’m comforted in hearing that when life allows for it that you’re willing to come visit me here! 

Ahahaha, my mom is kinda zwee! Maybe I get it from her! I think similarly to what you said I think sharing about her will come up naturally as she is the most significant person in my life. Of course if any questions ever pop up I’d be happy to answer them. 
I’m sorry you had to grow up fast too! 
*Little me is hugging little you.*
Yeah, we spoken about this a bit, but there is a lot of heavy stuff in my childhood and seems that is so for yours too. We haven’t delved into that as much. I agree, it does feels like these are conversations for our library time. 
Thank you! It seems like you are also doing similar work. I am continually impressed by your self awareness, rawness, and introspection! It is beautiful to witness that in you. 

Mmm wow that does sound hard to know about which it was. I feel a sadness thinking about that. Crying is such a release that I think many people are held back from socially, and I wish that wasn’t so. I think crying is a special and beautiful medicine. Thank you for pointing out that you can cry, that is good to know! I have met a few people who have expressed having a similar relationship with crying. I get that now. I didn’t used to understand that. I used to cry A LOT and as I get older I find that I cry less frequently, and when I do that it doesn’t seem to be until things have reached a certain intensity or depth. I wonder if it’s a natural progression thing or if it’s because I’ve been living by "smile now, cry later" for some time now. 

I am not sure I can even imagine what that was like growing up with four brothers, and what those adolescent years were like, and I have a vivid imagination! I know there are many stories there for sure!

I’m so glad we let our guards down and showed vulnerability to each other. I haven’t felt that I could be vulnerable on the levels that we have gotten on with almost anybody, aside from a couple of my dearest and closest girl friends! I’m glad that we both moved the way we did. It’s wild to think of all the micro choices we made adding up to get us to where we’re at right now. I am so happy that the universe gifted us that time and space too! And I’m beyond glad that we took chances on each other, and continue to do so! I too am grateful. And I’m so excited to explore with you! 

Yeah, it is frustrating and draining. I’ve really lost touch with how to conduct myself and how to make sales in that environment. It’s a place where men who feel entitled to woman in any capacity really stand out, and it is unfortunate that it’s a lot of them! That’s perhaps the weirdest thing about the job is you’re supposed to subtly sell the fantasy that it *isnt* just work for most of these men! The mental (and physical) gymnastics one has to do to do the job well are truly insane. 
I wish that more men treated the club as a place to honor and revere femininity. 
You’re hitting the alpha male thing on the head. I think you’re right about what that typically indicates when people self label that way! I used to think labels were helpful and to a certain extent I think that’s true. Language is limited in helping people find understanding unfortunately. I think labels are people’s attempt at finding understanding, community, resonance, identity, etc. 
I really do think it would be better if people stopped caring about labels and focused on being kind to one another. 
Ego is so interesting because as I understand it, it’s main function is to help protect the self. It’s a fine balance between allowing your ego to do its job and also keeping it in check because if it grows too strong it can also be detrimental to the ‘self’ and ‘others.’ Yeah the club environment completely caters to stroking the male ego. That’s why the club works. Very strange place to say the least! 

I do know that I didn’t deserve the mistreatment. I hope you also know that you did not deserve the mistreatment you’ve endured! I find it sweet of you to think of this! 
I have wondered a bit what it would be like if we had met at some earlier time. I honestly am unsure if we actually could have met and worked at an earlier time! I really think all of the journeys and lessons both of us went through prepared us to be who and how we are now. I will speak for me personally I actually know that I needed to experience a lot of exploration, experimentation, and really some "fuck around and find out" time. I think there is a lot that I did actually have to "get out of my system." 
It’s so hard to say how I would have been! I do believe you could have been good to me regardless! I almost think though that I might have been a bit like your exes in the sense that I think when I was younger I was looking for someone to "fill a void." I didn’t feel whole on my own at times. I think that’s just being young and figuring out who you are and learning to love yourself. I know I would never have cheated, that’s for sure! I wish we could have helped spare each other from mistreatment. 
*Slightly younger me is hugging slightly younger you.*
It seems to me we’ve both been working on healing ourselves, which is really powerful I think. And now we have a beautiful opportunity to help each other continue healing, together! I plan to treat you as gorgeously as I can in the present and the future! 

Hehehe thank you!!! You can hear me make them in your head already?! I’m still waiting for your voice to be imprinted in my mind more fully! I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the sounds you were making during your workout on the phone the other morning…I was laying in bed and hearing them did something to me! I may or may not have had to change my underwear after we talked on the phone. I’m not even kidding. I think it’s so cute and hot that you stayed on the phone while working out. I’m looking forward to learning what all of your little quirks and oddities are. Your voice alone is a stand out. I love hearing your voice and I love that I have to *really* listen to you. You’re so sweet on me with your words! Thank you! 
The fact that you’ve already heard me sing is massive. I cannot believe I sang a cappella in front of you!! I NEVER do that. There are people I’ve known for years that have never really heard me sing. Liquid courage I suppose. But even then I have found that I naturally am *unable* to sing in front of almost anyone and everyone. It’s one of THE most vulnerable things for me. I have massive stage fright in this realm. I’ve found that there are very few people I feel comfortable singing around. And I felt that with you naturally. I want you to know that is major. Because of this I have a strong feeling we will explore music together. I’m continuously excited for things with you! 

It really did. I feel as though I should read it once a year! I would love to read it to you! Next phone call remind me? I’ll read a little bit to you each phone call if you like! I love reading out loud and I love being read to by someone I care about. I don’t know if I mentioned that that’s my bookworm origin story; my mom used to read to us kids every single night until we were able to and then we’d all take turns reading. We had a lot of family reading time. Those are golden memories from my childhood! I’m on the same page with audiobooks being hard for me. The only person who I like recording of reading books is LeVar Burton from Reading Rainbow. He has a podcast reading show now, and I’ll listen every now and then cause he also has wonderful taste! I know for me a lot of audiobook readers have voices I simply can’t get behind. The other thing is I love the tangibleness of books. I love the way they feel and they way they smell. I love when they get worn and feel lived in. I’m a reading romanticist I suppose. 

You were similarly perceptive of me that night. I can’t remember verbatim, but I know I downplayed how I actually felt about Vegas and you saw right through it. I was surprised you called me out on it. I didn’t think I was being that obvious in how I really felt. No one seemed to notice before and if they had they didn’t say anything. I remember thinking that was perceptive of you! I’m not sure exactly. Maybe part of being able to perceive that you had scars was *in* being able to feel just how guarded you were. I know for me part of what I’m guarding sometimes is active wounds and also my own scars. It’s been my experience multiple times that when I  have revealed my scars someone has perpetuated the wounding and given me new and similar punctures! I have an example of something I’ve seen which has deeply disturbed me throughout the years. I have had multiple friends who had histories of being beaten and abused and when they’d be dating a new guy, who seemed sweet & good, and they got vulnerable and opened about that history the new guy would start beating and abusing them!!! I’ve seen it multiple times. Thankfully that’s not a trauma I’ve had. But I’ve actually seen some psychologists advise women not disclose to men about having histories like that because whether it’s a chicken or an egg thing it might trigger some men to treat them the very same way!! Of course with some men, good men, when they hear that they want to do anything but repeat the cycle of abuse. I think I’ve mentioned by now that there are many things I’ve refrained from disclosing early on with people and that is why.
I will say that with you I could feel that there was way more to you! I could feel that you had suffered and that you had scars, but I could also feel a warmth and a lightness in you that pleasantly surprised me! I now see that where that comes from is you working on your self love. I keep saying it but I’m so so glad you started that work before we met. I’m excited to see how you’ll transform even more with a continuous dedication to loving yourself! We’ve reached a level of vulnerability, in what I’d say is "early on" in getting to know each other that I didn’t know was possible. I think normally that would frighten me. I don’t feel frightened though, and I’m happily leaning into that. Vulnerability met with grace, understanding, and matched vulnerability turns into trust? Does that sound right? 

You are also on a similar trajectory with knowing me! This feels like a library moment in writing. I love being here with you. 
Aww, yeah I don’t know if that’s something a while ago I would have able to help with reminding someone of. I love this plan. I also plan to keep loving myself, so that I can show up as the best version of myself, for us. As I was reading and responding to this section of your letter it felt like my heart was glowing and singing! 

Are you letting me know that you’re not afraid to ride me? Ehehe, I think it’s supposed to be the other way round, but you can ride me. 
I can ride you. 
We can make the beast with two backs. Whatchyu know bout that? 
Hehe let me stahp. Back to the topic…
I could see you having to learn lessons that way and working to avoid that as much now. I’m working on that. I think that duality exists because I often slow down after I have a particularly bad "bump." I think the most recent thing that I think has taken a longer time for me to figure out is "when to leave" a job, a party, a relationship of any kind. I feel like I often ignore a lot of red flags that I should leave any of those things. Work is a big one where I’ll over stay! 
I find you charming and more too. I’m really swooning, or something more than swooning. I don’t even know if that’s the right word now. I am needing to expand my vocabulary to express my feelings to you!

Yeah, this makes a lot of sense to me on how even if it might not work perfectly, it would be better than no plan at all! It makes me wonder, do you know how you typically respond to conflict? Are you someone who needs space to not react immediately? Do you ever freeze up or shut down? Do you like to try to talk something out all the way in a single go? What are things that "trigger" you? What are things that calm you down? That’s a lot of questions I know! I’m just curious if maybe we could start getting an idea of what we could do if we ever did have an argument. And what we could do afterwards. 

I really am considering going back to school for these things. I realize I’ve been spending a good chunk of time loosely studying these things on my own time, so it wouldn’t be a massive leap to do so with structure and working towards something, a degree. I always excelled in school and found it incredibly easy to do so. I graduated with a 4.5 GPA and got into every school I applied to except for either Parsons or FIT I believe. I even got a couple of decent scholarships from other schools, but by the time I finished high school I really was burnt out. I went too hard. I really wanted to take a gap year and all of my advisors and parents were like "you’ve got almost enough college credits to graduate in only 2 more years, just finish off strong!" I listened against my intuition and I started going to college for art, which I think I briefly mentioned. I was despising it. And then I got t-boned by that arson investigator, and it gave me the excuse to drop out. I legitimately couldn’t make a number of my classes without a car. They were too early for the bus schedule. I think maybe I have some trauma to unpack with all of that. There was so much grief involved with college. 
I’m grateful I didn’t graduate with an arts degree. I’ve always thought I would have ended up dancing at some point anyways.
I’m gearing up to go back. I’ll admit I haven’t gone back partially because signing up for school, signing contracts/paperwork, applying for tuition/grants scholarships, that whole process is daunting. Like writing essays, doing projects, and taking tests isn’t daunting and has always been easy to me. No problem. I’ll admit something kind of embarrassing, but official paperwork is something I have a massive aversion to. I’m not sure why. 
Anyways, I appreciate you letting me know that you see something in me that I might be good with and being encouraging. That feels good! 
I think wherever I relocate to it won’t matter where I go back to school. I’ll just be excited to do so. Thank you for the kind words! I trust the universe with my peculiar timing. 

I think it’s so funny that you thought that about moving here! I don’t think it’d be something you’d enjoy too much, just from what I’ve learned about you. It’s a place that’s being flooded with LA cats too! I guess when you come out to visit me you might get better insight! I could be wrong. 
I do think we would have perhaps explored the deeper parts with each other, but maybe it would have taken longer? I don’t know. It’s hard for me to imagine any other scenarios, and I almost don’t want to because despite the distance I am cherishing this experience. The time, effort, care, and intention that each of us has been putting into these "letters" is unparalleled by anything I’ve ever experienced in communication. What’s more is I don’t know that many people these days could even be doing what we’re doing! Most people don’t read and write with such fervor! I’m glad you share this sentiment. 

It’s actually a notoriously bad city for dating! And of course Nevada is number one in the nation for divorce rates because of all the off the cuff weddings people have here! I actually have a friend from chicago who is about to have elope here in a couple of months before having a bigger ceremony in NYC next year! She’s a wild lady for that! Bless her lil heart! 
Yeah, I guess that’s hard to know! It’s all hypothetical. We’ll never know! In any case we’ve both been saying this in a kinds of different iterations, I’m glad you ended up where you did, and where you are now. I’m excited for wherever is next. It’s a great mystery! Gosh I love the way you put that about what type of town you’d like to move to. It does sound like we’re one the same page in that regard among many. It keeps surprising me! I really want to road-trip around the states again and explore. I don’t know when, but perhaps we could go searching together. 

I get what you’re saying. That so sweet of you! 
I think I mentioned that I feel like I’ve had to learn how to "father" myself this year. I recognize that a big portion of that feeling that I wanted someone to come save me came from finally acknowledging that I do have "daddy issues." I had observed women throughout the past year who had strong father figures and realized that they were taught certain things that I didn’t learn. My mom did her best, but she herself did not have a healthy father figure. I think for a lot of the last year I had thought to myself that maybe I wouldn’t be where I was at if I had a good father figure. But I also know girls in the industry who seem to have great fathers! So who knows. I felt a lot of resentment in my last relationship because when I was dancing men would sometimes ask not only about my father situation, but if I had a "man" and sometimes I’d be honest and say ‘yes’ and to that they’d respond that if I had a "good" man or a "real" man that I wouldn’t need to work in the club. I realized that I was working at the club again because I wasn’t making enough money at my other jobs, and my ex wasn’t working at all really. He’d do just enough random gigs to pay his portion of rent and the rest of the shared living expenses I would cover. I realized that I had never *really* had any men in my life provide for me or protect me. It sort of made me sick when I realized that. I started thinking that perhaps I might not be dancing or escorting if I had either a good father figure or a partner that was a provider/protector. I mentioned my siblings have a different biological father and that he adopted me. I don’t know if I mentioned that he is likely a millionaire and has provided endlessly for my younger siblings- cars, rent, school books, school tuition, etc. When I was in college he didn’t share a dime. And that’s when and kind of why I started "sugaring." I do feel that I took matters into my own hands and I’m proud of that. My first sugar daddy was the best you could really ask for. My adopted father has continued to deny helping me financially, even for schooling, in any capacity despite knowing my struggles. He refuses to have a conversation with anyone about why as well. I have been doing my best to forgive not only my biological father and my adopted father, but all the men who’ve ever done me wrong too, just within myself and for my own peace. At a certain point I felt I needed to do something to change my narrative and to call in new experiences with men. I will say I don’t think I started having better experiences with men until I really started affirming and believing that I was worthy of being treated so much better. I have been wondering if I would have even met you had I not started this inner work.
There’s a lot to unpack with this topic. It’s definitely one to explore more in our library. 
I’m overjoyed to be able to be so honest with you and to have that honesty met with you letting me know that you understand, care about, and respect me! Thank you, truly! 

So cool and not surprising that you were semi obsessed with fractals! Ahaha I love that! Yes I am familiar with sacred geometry! I still love and am fascinated by both! You know about so many things! It is rare to find somebody as interested or knowledgeable about many of the things you are! I am continually amazed by how many shared interests we have! 

That might just be the sweetest thing anybody has ever said to me about wanting me to be your life’s work! I’m not discouraged in any way. Normally, I’d be skeptical but as we’ve  both touched on, in so many words, that what’s developing between you and I is truly rare. I have gushed about you to my best besties by now. One of my friends said, "Twenty one paragraph letters! Y’all are insane, but on some other shit for sure!" Ahaha 
My feelings are mutual! I find you equally unique and fascinating, and I’m only loving learning more and more about you. Zweee!!! You’re soo much nerdier than I had initially thought!! I hope you know I’m not just saying this to say it, but I think I would like to spend my life studying you too. *I’m blushing so hard.*

I’m hoping to find out when I have to time so soon! It’s truthfully driving me nuts that I have to make this work transition at this moment in time! 

There’s really a multitude of reasons why I got into dancing at 18. I know I’ve mentioned some of these. In no particular order: I was getting sexually harassed all the time as a server, when I went out to party and hit the dance floors a couple times people would throw money on me or a whole room would be watching and hyping me up, the money, and I wanted to get over my stage fright with singing. I figured if I could strip in front of a live audience what could be more vulnerable? It never did help though. Now I can just strip tease in front of anyone. Like that’s just my flesh suit. I feel like singing is baring a part of my soul though. That’s sidebar to your question though. I stopped dancing for a number of reasons and then the reason I started again at 23/24 was because of what I mentioned earlier in this letter. I simply needed to make more money. I wanted to work for myself because I had had two jobs pull the same shit on me of hiring and training me to be a manager, and using me as a manager without proper pay. 
It is clear to me that you take respect seriously. It’s something that makes me fond of you! 
Thank you!! I trust I will find something adequate. 

Ehehe I’m just messing with you! You’re allowed to stalk me anytime you want! I think it’s so cute that you watched it multiple times to see me in it! That makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside! It makes me feel Zwee! Hehe yeah I need to workshop zwee coming in black more. Is black and white cool? My brain is storming with some interesting stuff now. 

I do indeed feel special at this point. I hope you do too! Wow! Maybe it’s a new awareness for you? Maybe you’ve not given it much thought? Or perhaps I really am the first in this lifetime? 
I’ve been hip to believing in the possibility of having connections with people from different dimensions or past lives for a while now. I’ve had a number of friends who do energy work, so I think I’ve had more exposure to certain possibilities. I have a couple of platonic friends that the connection feels that way. When people talk about "soul family" I think of them. 
I will say the magnetization that I’ve felt to you is unparalleled in my life! There’s so many "I couldn’t tell you whys but I just felt that I had to" for me about the night we met and in the time we had after that. I felt almost no anxiety about trusting you. I was glad that you asked if I thought that was possible. It’s funny to me because something that has bothered me is that various men this year had said "I miss you" after 1 date and even loftier things like "I miss your soul" and I would say, "You don’t KNOW me at all. You certainly don’t know my soul." I couldn’t feel their souls. They all got a very guarded version of me. I know that in the past year I had been sharpening my feeling to be indifferent with men no matter how handsome, or interesting, or cool, etc. they seemed and I was able to maintain that indifference easily. But with you something that shocks me is the emotional charge I had even from the night we met. I have been wondering that if we had "missed each other" in an even more pointed way that night we met I would still be thinking about you and wondering what could have been. 
With all that being said, I do feel that I miss you! 

I’ll be happy to see what grows too! I’m glad that you say that there is no rush. I mention earlier that of course I’d love to see you ASAP and at the same time I don’t feel the need for a rush. I trust that we will be able to be together in the flesh in good time. The wait is going to make it that much sweeter! I am itching to use the expression that I can’t wait to see you again! I certainly will of course! I’m absolutely buzzing with surges of yummy energy thinking about it! I want to spend time with you too. And I want to know you, deeply, as deeply as you’ll let me.
