Woah, I didn’t see this coming! Thank you for sharing your “Dharma Bums” story with me! I still had it in my list of asks. I had a feeling and just from what I observed you haven’t seemed “to care about sexual orientation, religion, race, creed, etc.” I believe all of those labels are separations that people place on themselves and others and really at the end of the day we’re all more alike than we are different I think. It’s incredibly important to me that the people I have in my life generally respect everyone and anyone who isn’t hurting anyone. You’ll find out why that’s so important to me at some point. I still haven’t told you about my unique high-school education, so you’ll have to remind to talk about “Amy Biehl.” It’s too much to write about.
I’m so relieved to know that you’ve had good friendships with queer people! 
That’s quite a compliment to me and your old roommate from San-Fran! Thank you! If you have good stories about that time I’d love to hear em! And wow, it sounds like your friend from Vegas is on quite a journey! What’s her name? That way you don’t have to keep saying the long winded “friend from Vegas.” 
Ooo I like the addition of this idea to dinner night! I wouldn’t know how to set that up, but if you do I’m so down! And I’ll keep my eyes peeled for drag events like that down the line!

I know that I’ve met people in relationships who have exemplified that possibility. I had a really interesting 21st birthday experience that this makes me think about! It’s another phone call story. I am also keeping an open mind about being able to experience that kind of relationship dynamic at some point in my life.
Hehe yesss!! Who cares? It’s your life. Cliche up that repertoire! 

Wow, yeah observing that in your mother might be a part of where that comes from. I realize that I observed a similar thing with my mom growing up. I know for me that bled a lot into how I showed up in relationships with other people. I also have “older sister syndrome!” 
That says a lot about her, you saying she’s the toughest person you’ve ever known, even out of fighters!  I feel honored that you share things about your mother with me. 

Yes I agree with you, many men need to be challenging themselves more. Yeah I’m with you. I have so many thoughts on this whole “alpha male culture” and “red pill” thing that’s going. I’ve been doing so much studying on it because it actually has been influencing how things are in the club! There are so many lost and vulnerable young men and they’re getting swooped into something that is dangerous to say the least. But it’s true, as a society we do need men who can provide and be protective when the occasion is called for.
Oooh! I really like this quote about the warrior and the gardener. That’s gooood! And the next one is good too! 
I like how you put this last bit. Especially that last sentence! I think that’s a nice “reframe.” Reframing has changed my life. I’ve come to reframe a lot of the things that have happened in my life as lessons and it’s so much more helpful. Makes it as to where “life is happening for me, not to me” sometimes. 

I think most of us have made that conflation. I know I certainly have in the past. I also think most people struggle with self love. Especially here in America we’re bombarded with messages all around us and all the time that we’re incomplete and undesirable. It creates a culture where many people who don’t love themselves are trying to love each other. 
Have you read or heart of “All About Love” by Bell Hooks? This book changed my life completely. I read it after my breakup last year, and it’s one of the few books I’ve read that I think anybody who can read-should read! If they can get it in their language too. It’s full of universally important lessons. 
It pains my heart to hear that you spent any time actively hating yourself! I’m glad you found you couldn’t take that anymore and have been on your self-love and self-preservation journey. I’m also glad that you mention it’s always a work in progress. I wanted to say that too. I know we keep saying things to this effect, but I’m joyous that we’ve met when we have. 

Hehe I’m glad you agree! I’m not sure about being pages ahead of you! What makes you say that? 

I agree with what you say about what is essential to maintaining a healthy and meaningful relationship. I think your feeling about why we circle around the same themes is accurate too. A couple months back I listened to an incredible podcast with the Gottman Doctors, they’re a married couple of psychologists that have been married for 35 years and for 40 years they’ve been studying relationships! They have a part of the interview where they touch on different practices to use in conflict resolution. They suggested that in the early stages, before you ever have a fight, to discuss different triggers each other might have (whether you’re a fight, flight, freeze, or fawn oriented person when it comes to conflict) and to make a “game plan” or a protocol on what to do when a fight comes up. It makes so much sense! I’ve also thought that in addition to that plan it might be helpful to make an “aftercare” plan too. 
I’ll send over the podcast if you’d like to give it a listen! It’s long, but it’s a worthwhile listen.
I realize I’ve been studying a lot about neuroscience, psychology, relationships, and love in the last year. 
Good communication is undoubtedly the foundation. If the foundation starts crumbling it’s a wrap. I remember that part of the conversation and I was very much the same! What was so messed up in my last relationship, and why it lasted so long, is because my ex would discuss with me and help me understand. I would think that we were actually growing together and getting stronger, but he would never change his behavior. And I would continue to get disrespected. My ex would not let me go and would continue to benefit from my understanding and self sacrifice. I almost think it’s better that you were “let go” by your exes. Otherwise you might’ve found yourself that much more “hallowed” afterwards, perhaps. I know I’ve had to do a lot to not beat myself up for staying for so long. 
I likewise wouldn’t ask you to promise to not disappoint me or to be perfect. And I hope you didn’t think that I was saying that’s what you were saying in the last letter. I just want to be incredibly intentional and thorough in talking about all of these things with you, and I’m continually impressed by you matching my energy in this way! 
I was going to say something very similar about there never really being a loss here. You took the words right out of my mind it feels. I’ve been thinking that to myself about you, that you haven’t made any promises or laid out any expectations in the entire time we’ve been talking. Many men have come out the gate with bold promises this year and it’s always felt and has actually been faulty. It seems to me that you wouldn’t ever make a promise you didn’t full heartedly believe you could come through on. For myself I’ve learned to do my best to not make promises without that kind of confidence and determination. 
It does something yummy for me that your last two sentences rhyme! 
I would be remiss if I passed over the opportunity to give it my all as well. 

That’s kind of the thing is, it’s a place where I’m not sure morality matters at all. That’s why all the pondering and questioning. I always likened it to “Pandora’s Box” and working in that environment is wild to say the least. I have one story in particular that has made me think about the moral compass thing a lot. I call it “the incident.” Even just being in Vegas, which is nicknamed “sin city” has brought up a lot. Much of this feels like it is a topic for going to our library. Ask me next time on the phone to tell you that story. 
Hmmm yeah I thought about acting a lot in the last year. One of my best friends of all time is a fellow dancer and an actor and she made me aware that to be a dancer is to be an actor. It’s okay to let your real persona sprinkle through to your dance persona, but the other way round I’m not so sure. If you’re not careful to stay in touch with who you are you can lose yourself. I definitely think being guarded is a form of masking. Ahaha the “spaghetti” thing is something I heard someone say in terms of just experimenting and seeing what sticks or works. 
I’d like to be “throwing spaghetti” with other creative ventures. Soon.
I think I mentioned that I do much better in Chicago. I think it’s because that city has such rich culture. My artsy and intellectual attributes do well there. I would have stayed there had I known what I know about Vegas and the club culture here! But now I wouldn’t go back because I can’t handle the weather. And I wouldn’t necessarily take it back either. I think I came here to do some hard but important development. 
I’m glad I didn’t give you any bullshit. I think you said something at some point about being on a similar or the same frequency? If you didn’t I think this is in my mind because of the “same book” thing we have going now.
Something about you made me feel that I could show up in that way. 

Unfortunately, these men just don’t know how much detrimental programming they have. They don’t know about or believe in patriarchy. They don’t see the way in which patriarchy is hurting them, but they are feeling the effects. And they don’t know what a problem it is. 
It sounds like you get it! I’m deeply relieved! I can’t tell you how many pointless debates I’ve had about this in the last year. 
The not “waiting for someone to save me” has been a big theme this year. It interesting that you put it in those words. 
Being able to discuss this with you openly is truly refreshing and rejuvenating. You may always let me know when something makes you uncomfortable and of course if you need clarification or to dig deeper to gain a better understanding. I really do feel as though I can tell you anything. It’s a freeing feeling. 
Thank you for that. 

I really do! So much so that you’re definitely not overstepping in suggesting it as a tattoo idea. I had already looked into it haha! 
Since I know a lot about clothes I do in fact know about this difficulty in finding unbranded clothing in general! Is it weird that I want to see your closet so badly?? I mean I want to see how it is that you live in general. 
Ehehe I wasn’t intimidated by what you said. I suppose I was being cheeky in a way. I’m glad for the assurance! I see nothing wrong with getting lost or staying in and savoring those types moments. Wuww now I’m intimidated because I don’t know how to respond to what you’re saying here! You’re making me blush in more than one place! I’m roused for when we are physically in the same time and space!

It’s alright. I think unfortunately that survival mode is what many people live in for a long time. I’m glad I’ve never given up and am still not giving up on reaching a place of thriving. I have experienced tastes of that. I’m unsure if that it’s a place one can be in constantly either since life “throws lemons” at everyone from time to time. Life takes us up down n all around, I always say. I am a bit tired admittedly. Especially this week. They say when your nervous system starts regulating you are often exhausted because you can actually and do need to rest. I never thought I’d look forward to “clocking in” at a straightforward job again, but for the time being I am. 
In regards to Zwee, did you get a chance to look at my website? There should be a video on the main page. I feel like that shares the vibes a bit. I am Zwee really! I love that you changed my last name to that in your contacts. 
I think we are already experimenting creatively too. It does feel like a dance. In my mind when you first started messaging back with similar depth and length, I was like huh “he’s going bar for bar” with me! It feels like a writing cypher (it’s a hip hop thing where people take turns improvising individual verses, dances, etc.). 

That’s messed up! Having things thrown at you! I apologize! I’m giggle gaggled at how you put that! I admit I made an excuse to touch you early on in dinner. I’m unsure if you noticed, but I used your low register as an excuse to touch you/get closer. I remember touching your thigh! You seemed a little taken aback actually haha. As we spent more time together I did notice that our physical affection progressed. It was a sweet progression! I’m glad you knew to “let me come to you.” I suppose that’s why I thought girls might throw themselves at you. It’s something I’ve observed makes us women want a man more. Or maybe that’s just me. I’m not sure. I suppose I’m a bit like a cat. You are sensitive and sweet with me and I’m grateful to experience these sides of you. Mmm that’s something I could probably learn from you. I think people often mistake my kindness for weakness.

Everything shared between us, up to this point makes me feel that I can do that with you. I hope that you feel the same. Thank you for making time and continuing to show up in this capacity. I wish I could top of my thank you with a long hug and a kiss! 
This song is perfect! Planning is a bit of a theme throughout this letter! I can’t top off this letter with a hug and a kiss, but I am now topping it off with letting you know that I do have a plan for something…
