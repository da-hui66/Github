That’s cool that you’ve been to a couple of shows! I’m wondering how you ended up there not being super knowledgeable or immersed in the culture? I had been meaning to ask if you have or have ever had any queer friends in your life? I think regardless of being a part of or knowing anything about queer culture, anyone with an open mind and a love for the creative spirit can appreciate drag. I’m feeling zweeee to know that you’d be open to watching some drag race with me! I honestly think a live drag show is even better, and sometimes some of the queens perform live music! I’ll keep that in the wheelhouse of potential outings we can go do together.

Yes, and something that enlivens me about us individually is that we both seem to be people who are willing to learn, unlearn, change, and to work on ourselves for ourselves. Which is key. I think when two people who are like that get together it’s probably a good thing. I have yet to experience that, so it’s just a theory. 
I am nodding my head to all of this! I love the “zig-zagging” concept you have going on. Ahaha why not live by another one? I always say they exist for a reason. I think we all want to not *be* a cliche, but I think living by a number of them can’t be so bad. 

Of course at the moment my mind draws a blank. More questions about your childhood will pop up naturally. This is probably easier to talk about over the phone because I think it might require you telling me stories, and I’d love to *hear* you tell those. I’m interested to find out what you find when you do this reexamination! I thought about sending you the article! I’ll send it to you! I thought that was interesting too, but makes total sense. We’re all  only human. I also think it might be one of those things where some people are great at listening and giving advice but don’t necessarily “practice what they preach.” 
Some questions pop into my mind now. Was your mom a super self sacrificing lover with her partners? And could that be where you observed a love model from? Or could it be from possibly how your mom was with mothering you and your siblings-like did she display never-ending self sacrifice in an extreme way for y’all? These are the possibilities that pop into my mind. 
You say something that is so interesting to me because I’ve been listening to research on this “male loneliness epidemic” and about the growing “incel movement” and what neuroscientists and psychologists have been saying is that it’s a very male prerogative to do things to feel needed. Like men need to be needed. Because the male contribution to propagating life is so minimal in the creation sequence-i.e just providing sperm, historically the things that men were doing that were super important were “providing” and “protecting.”
This is slight side bar (I’m gonna wrap it back round to you after, bare with me.) but we’re seeing so many lonely men because they are not fulfilling the ways in which they have been needed because they are not generally being needed in the same ways they were historically and because of that they aren’t as motivated to even try! Women are outnumbering men in continued education and excelling in all kinds of positions they weren’t ever even included in before. We’re in a weird social evolution where the old guidelines don’t apply. People don’t know how to adapt. To draw this back to you, I think from what I’ve heard and observed that you naturally are a provider/protector, which I think many women still need/want (and needs and wants are different too/there’s so much to all of this) I can imagine that the women you were with recognized that, were attracted to that, and utilized you for that. 
What’s interesting is I think most people want to be needed. I’m thinking now that people are most likely conflating feeling needed with feeling loved. Need doesn’t equal love. And the biggest thing we all *actually* need is love. Self love being the most important! I’m drawing it back to the likelihood that you have most likely picked women who didn’t love themselves. And forgive me if I’m wrong, but it sounds like you also might not have loved yourself as much as you needed to? And that through your continued pattern of unrelentless giving with not only not receiving in return but being lied to and cheated on, you were sent into a journey of practicing deeper self love and self preservation. I know with my last relationship I had a good amount of self love when I met my ex and through the relationship I realized that I had let my self respect/love wane by allowing myself to be so disregarded and disrespected. I had to rebuild my self love. 
Idk idk that was a lot! I have so many thoughts, things to share from studies, questions etc. you’ll find that I’m always attempting to synthesize everything. 

I’m loving this theme of reading lingo we’re using. I’m beginning to wonder if we’re from the same book?! 
I think it’s healthy to reserve some hesitation. I too have been disappointed a lot in my lifetime. Not to be a debby downer, but I think that realistically disappointment is inevitable in any type of relationship at some given point in time. It all depends on what the disappointment is and if reconciliation is possible after. I don’t think I could ever promise I won’t disappoint you at some point, but I can say that I strive to do my best in taking accountability. I think one of the most heartbreaking things is when there’s a break in communication. Good communication seems to be one of the most defining pillars of a healthy relationship. I’ll do my best to keep open communication with you, even if I think it might be painful. The communication we are having is something I’ve never experienced before, feels like I likely never will again, and that honestly is something that scares me a little bit- because it’s an uncharted territory and the possibility of the loss of it. I’m willingly to risk the loss and traverse the unknown with you. The way you communicate is unparalleled. For this alone I will likewise remember and cherish you always!
Ahaha I’ll let you know when I need to be caught! I was attempting a couple of letters ago to describe what “library time” is like and you nailed it! I love that. 

I’m not sure if you’re familiar with “radical honesty” but I think that’s similar to “being impeccable with your word.” I’d like to live practicing radical honesty. It’s something I’m working towards. 
I have often struggled with keeping my personal moral compass intact because of the club. There’s temptation for so much immorality and questioning of what is moral in that environment anyways? You can choose to be authentic/honest and sometimes that makes you money and sometimes lying/acting makes you money. And sometimes yes you have to lie for your safety. Your name is a falsehood and that’s for safety. Lying/masking so much does something to you. I can only imagine what goes on with actors brains! 
I really lost my sales mojo out here. I had to hustle so different from how I did in chicago. 
I think because of that for most shifts recently I would just “throw spaghetti at the wall” and see what would stick. I think I know how the truth roulette started. It starting seeming like it didn’t matter which way I tried to be. There was no rhyme or reason to it. 
I think I’ve mentioned, from what little you gave me in words and energy I think I felt that you didn’t want any bullshit, so I didn’t give you any. Now I know that you want the truth, can handle it, and if you can’t that I’d be understanding of you walking away if you can’t. I appreciate you for being transparent with me too! I think what we have going is so special in a world full of lies, deceit, manipulations, and illusions! 

It is unfair, but I’m glad to be aware of that about myself, and I’m glad to know that there are people and spaces where I don’t have to do that! Yeah there were some people that I dated that I hadn’t met at work. I think some of it was jealousy and some of it was just flat out misogyny and what I mentioned before “whorephobia.” Most of the guys I dated didn’t have an issue with the dancing, a little jealousy some. But the few guys I told the truth about doing escort work were incredibly disgusted by me and disrespectful to me. I understand not wanting to be with someone who escorts for the reason of wanting to be exclusive. I think there’s a polite way to express that. And not that we could have gotten there for them to know that had things been compatible for us and had I been asked to be exclusive, I would have agreed. But they were people who couldn’t and wouldn’t understand many things about why anyone would do that. It’s so interesting because everyone knows that it’s considered the oldest profession in the world. And they’re incredibly okay with hooking up with lots of random women, rarely ever being “safe” and objectifying these women to the point that they’re essentially “masturbating” with women’s bodies. They’re allowed to have high body counts. They devalue the women they hook up with. And they cannot fathom a woman who has self determined her worth/value and is capitalizing on that. They will judge a woman who has put a boundary and a stipulation on who has access to her body and energy. I stand firm in saying that if men were as sexually desirable many men would do nothing but have sex for money!
Anyways there’s a lot there. I could go on and on. I had harbored a lot of shame for having engaged in escorting, but then I did a lot of studying history and socioeconomics and now I don’t feel bad and I won’t be made to feel bad about it. It was something I had to do at times and it’s part of my story. I’m incredibly glad to be able to be honest with you. I mentioned it already up there, so now I’m reiterating, but I do feel that if I told you something you couldn’t handle or accept that you would respectfully communicate that, and that’s all I ask for! 

Honestly, my gauge isn’t perfect. It’s an intuition thing, and I’m wrong from time to time, naturally. I think I just learned by trial and error and pattern recognition. I wouldn’t know how you could hone that for yourself. I think I often turn away people I can’t get a read on. 

Indeed ahaha. I really am full of multitudes. Your mobius comment really does make me feel incredibly seen! I feel deep resonance with that. I think I got all of that about how you present yourself! I’ve known many people who’ve worn all black all the time, but even many of them cared about branding. I’ve never met someone with your intentionality and philosophy about it. It’s soo different from me. I love that! And wow what you say about thinking there hasn’t ever been or ever will be a person like me again is such a massive compliment and at the same time you are right on a reality level hehe! We are all unique little snowflakes lol! Likewise no one else has existed that is like you or ever will! I’ve truly never had the pleasure of meeting a person like you. You certainly strike me as an impressively strong man both mentally and physically. I don’t know if I want you to get lost in me though…maybe momentarily lost in my eyes or the universe between my legs. 

Ahaha I love it! You’re even more of an alien than me in that regard! I think it’s good. “I like people that are strange and unusual because…..”finish my sentence. Most of my interests are different than the rest of the people around me, but I somehow stay mostly up to date. The hive mind is strong and pervasive these days lol. We kinda talked about this at dinner when we talked about reality tv. I feel similarly. I do think it’s a waste of time. For me. And I say the same too! If other people enjoy it good for them. Different strokes for different folks. 

Honestly, ever since I moved to chicago like 7 years ago I haven’t ever really stabilized. I’ve pretty much been in survival mode that whole time and I’ve had a lot of grief. I create mostly and best from a place of thriving, joy, and love. I create with the feeling of Zwee! A lot of people can create and are fueled, it seems, by their depression or struggle, but not me. There’s so many things that I think weakened my creative fire. There’s a lot to unpack there. 
Yeah, it’s a good sign about you that I feel creative sparks. I think part of that has to do with being able to be so open with you! I think true creativity can only happen when you don’t feel encumbered by judgement or expectations and you can be free to explore like a child. I do look forward to the days where we can experiment creatively together! I’m curious what will come of that too. It’s cool that your modes for catharsis are first nature to you now! I strive to be there. 

Yeah, I see all of that now haha. I now think it’s funny that I thought you might be like that! I may have been projecting my own experiences on you simply because I thought you were really handsome and a smooth talker. I thought you might be the kind of guy that doesn’t even have to pursue a girl, that girls might throw themselves at you. I’ve seen it before! 
I know now that that’s not how you are. You are as genuine as they come it seems! And it doesn’t sound like girls are throwing themselves at you. Right? 
I didn’t realize you made excuses to touch me ahaha. I wanted to touch and be touched by you probably just as much as you wanted to. I think there were a couple of moments when we were out n about on the town where I was overwhelmed by how much I wanted that. They’re all pretty important to me, the least important one is “receiving gifts.” I think I’m “fluent” in all of them. I think if I had to narrow it down though a trifecta of physical touch, quality time, and acts of service are equally important to me. 

Ahaha yeah I didn’t question if you were into me thankfully. I just questioned in what capacity. And now I’m elated because I know that you’re interested in me in interesting ways! I’m glad that we understand each other too. 
I could feel your guard lowering and lowering over the span of the time we spent together. Could you feel that I had a guard as well? And could you feel it lowering? 
You’re so sweet and sensitive I keep wanting someone to pinch me and reassure me that you’re real and not a delusion I’m experiencing. Wuww I like your use of compounding! I’m blushing. Hard. I had no idea either! With every exchange I too feel that my being into you is expanding. I’m melting. This last sentence is so sweet I feel lame in simply saying that I feel the same way about you! 

That’s kind of how my brain works all the time. It is running possibilities at almost all times. Sometimes it feels simultaneous. I wonder sometimes if it’s insights into parallel realities. Realistically it’s extreme overthinking at best. I have been told that I’m generally considerate. It’s actually annoying. I think it’s funny that you find it impressive. You are also revealing yourself to be a considerate person. 
Indeedypoo, life is fascinating! One little decision could have really changed everything! I know we keep saying it, but I’m pleased as punch that we made all of the particular decisions we did! 
Wowoweewa that is one of the sweetest things someone has EVER said to me! I’m cry a lil happy tear 🥲 

Awe, I don’t want to apply them to you or put them on you, but I’ll definitely always try to communicate when I’m having anxiety. I’ll let you help me walk through what it might be stemming from, if that’s what you’d like to do. Same goes for you! Mmm patience is such a beautiful thing. Thank you for sharing these words. 
I could truly tell. I remember you asked multiple times if I was sure, and it wasn’t just that you asked it was how you asked. I’m glad you didn’t invite me to your room. That would have changed everything I think. I think you might be right about the next day. We did take things to a new depth and exactly that ahaha. It was sweet spending the day with you right up until you left! There are some moments from that day that I’m relishing and keep replaying in my mind. They are dear to me now. 
I’m like hearing that you’re not going anywhere soon! And that you don’t have any plans at the moment. Aside from figuring out a new job, I too have no plans at the moment.
