- I do not want to make you feel that you are not enough or your efforts are not enough, I did that when we were together and it makes me feel terrible that I ever let you feel that way. Because it is the exact opposite of the truth. I keep saying it because I mean it "you are the only thing I want, my favorite, everything else is a bonus"

- I want you to know I'm not asking you to be better. I'm just asking you to be the Janelle I know and love, just with the extra consideration that things are delicate right now and will heal with time. I know that I can take a lot on, but I have told you when it comes to matters of the heart, I'm not as strong as you are emotionally and can't just push the hurt away. I am trying and I do forgive you as promised, and intend to keep my word of not bringing things up and starting fresh. I just need you to recognzie the amount of effort that is required of me to do this. So when you are frustrated and impatient when I feel things, it makes me feel like shit, worthless, and triggers me to how I felt when you left and that's not a good place to go back to. I've done a lot of work to heal the parts of me that got broken and working on the rest to get back to being whole again, all I'm asking is for some grace and understanding (and I am aware that is irony coming from me - to this I am also so very sorry)

- I see and feel you putting in effort. Please know that it is noticed, apprecaited, and cherished. I want you to try and understand that I'm not going back and forth on 'if' you're trying. I know you are. I'm simply expressing that I hoped you would have something to say when I read my letter and it disappointed me that there was no response (not that 'you' disappointed me). I know you, and I don't have unrealistic expectations of your repsonses to things. Does it mean that it dosent hurt? No. But that's the difference now, I bring it up that it hurts so that it gets expressed and then let go, and dosent become this monsotrosity that compounds when something else happens. This is literally me breaking the patterns that you say 'pushed you away'. I don't need you to acknowldge my feelings and respond 'better'. I need you to be approachable because things are different now, I will say how I feel because I don't want things to go how they did before, and I'm encouraging you (and hopefully making you feel comfortable enough) to do the same. I just need to be able to talk to you about the way I feel without you getting overwhelmed, feeling frustrated, or that I'm reverting my opionions. (particularly if things are downstream of the pain that I didn't deserve) You said the inability to come to me and discuss was one of the reasons for you leaving and now I'm giving you that, all I'm asking is for the same in return. Saying what bothers you to the person you care about and cares about you is supposed to be nuturing and healing. 


- I sense that there is some underlying concern that you are afraid that I will just throw my hands up and walk away and you will feel stupid for coming back after trying. I'm not going anywhere. I did that while we were together because I didn't understand or know what I know now and it cost me the person I love the most and an unbelieveable amout of heartbreak. I can't lose you again. That dosen't mean I wont let you go if you want to go (we've certainly been down that road), but what I mean is that I'm going to give it everthing I got to be the person you 'want' to spend your life with. I'm going to give this the same amount of effort and passion that made me want to come get you across state lines. The only way this dosent work out is if you decide that you don't want it and I'll let you go and not chase you. But if you are going to be here please be here all the way, if you don't believe in it then be honest with yourself, because this means a lot to me, likely more than you'll ever realize. 

- I've said it before, "I can't not love you". It isn't up to me anymore. It's just a fact of my life now and I know at times I wasn't the best at showing you that. I certainly did regretable things that made you doubt that but I have every intention to right my wrongs and be a much better lover and partner to you. I hope that sooner than later you will get together again and you will come home to me.
