Today is Christmas, so I wanted to take a moment and remind you of how much a gift you are to all the lives that you touch, but especially to me. If you go back and read my early letters when we were getting to know each other, I'm sure you'll run across my mention of how beautifully unique you are. A few months later, I cannot say that's lessened even in the slightest. Each day I fall more in love with you as I get to know you better, and continue to feel so fortunate that that we made the decision we did to give us a try. If you would have told me months ago on the night we met, how our lives would be in the way they are now, I wouldn't beleive it could be anything close to the truth. Life is wonderfully suprising, and truth is indeed much stranger than ficition. Despite the way everything was stacked for us not to succeed, we found a way to make it this far and it gives me all the hope in the world that we can go the distance together. There is a lot of first's this holiday season for me, but I think you are more than worth it to be the one I announce to the world that I am undeniablly in love with. Looking forward to Christmas year after year with you, and all the other days in between. I love you dearly,

Merry Chirstmas
