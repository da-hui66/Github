Today is Christmas, so I wanted to take a moment and remind you of how much a gift you are to all the lives that you touch, but especially to me. If you go back and read my early letters when we were getting to know each other, I'm sure you'll come across my mention of how beautifully unique you are. After these months that have passed, I cannot say that's lessened even in the slightest. Each day I fall more in love with you as I get to know you better and continue to feel so fortunate that we made the decision we did to give us a try. If you had told me on the night we met, how our lives would be the way they are now, I wouldn't believe it could be anything close to the truth. Life is wonderfully surprising, and truth is indeed much stranger than fiction. Despite the way everything was stacked for us not to succeed, we make our relationship work and thrive together, and it gives me all the hope in the world that we can go the distance. There is a lot of firsts this holiday season for me, but I feel you are the one that I want the people closest to me to know that I am undeniably in love with and want to spend my life with. Iâ€™m looking forward to each Christmas year after year with you, and all the other days in between. 

I love you dearly,
Merry Chirstmas
