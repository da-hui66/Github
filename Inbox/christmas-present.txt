I wanted to get you something that you've been wanting but it isnt something I can buy outright so it took some thinking. I know that friends and community is something that you have been wanting in your life, and you want it to be with like minded people who share similar values as you. So I figured the best gift I could give you is to put you into position to make it happen for yourself. That being said, I've found three yoga studios in the area that I think would be a good fit for you. I want to sponser three drop-ins PER STUDIO (3x classes at each), so that you can try each one and see which one you think you would be the the right fit for you. Then once you figure out which one you like best, I'll sponser 3x MONTHS so that you can enjoy being out of the house, doing yoga, and meeting new people. Below are three good options I found in my research, I hope one of them works for you.


1. My Vinassa Practice
2. Flow Yoga
3. Black Swan Yoga - Anderson
