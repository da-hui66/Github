Before I forget (again) Apache Casino Hotel reservation number: LS6C3 It’s under your name, Jean-James Kubacak and your mom is listed as the guest (Antonia Kubacak - if I spelled it wrong please call in and correct it) so she can check in without you if needed. With the confirmation number you can make any changes or get any answers you need. 

Check in: 9/26/24 Check out: 9/29/24

To get to the POW WOW, you’ll drive to the Comanche Nation Tribal Complex located at: 

      584 NW Bingo Rd. Lawton, OK 73507

When you arrive you’ll park in a gravel lot near a playground. You’ll walk past the playground toward the carnival rides and to the right side until you reach the fence line. Follow the fence line back until you reach the campgrounds, and you’ll see a trail leading to the right. This is the trail to the POW WOW arena. There will be a covered area and bleachers bordering the covered area. Set your chairs under the covered area (there are two side areas and a back area, I recommend either side area for a better vantage point).

There is a culture of respect of property, so you can leave your chairs and enjoy the rest of the POW WOW. It will be announced when it’s time to start the ceremonies. They also have programs available to keep track of time yourself, but it’s commonly known here Native culture does not place heavy value on punctuality, so it’s not uncommon for the ceremonies to start later than scheduled (they’ll announce it if this is the case).
I also recommend bringing a fan and water bottle for your mom because it gets very hot and in Oklahoma we have dry heat.
