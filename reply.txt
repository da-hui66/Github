I know there is no expectation in terms of replying to your letter. I want to inform you that Friday through Sunday there is a different formula and rhythm to my schedule. I don't think I went into that much on the first call. I remember you asking me but then we changed the subject. As these letters have increased in length and complexity, it requires more time to produce a thoughtful and meaningful reply. I want you to know that is not taxing to me whatsoever, I'm just passing along that I not only look forward to reading your letter but also replying to it when I get the chance. I suppose I am still working out the timing these days. Maybe if you end up working at the club tonight, this will be something you enjoy coming home to.


After hearing more about your high school and the curriculum you were exposed to in such a formative time in your life, the more transparent your mindfulness is about your views on ethics and morality for humanity's interaction with each other. I could see there was a lot of this in you as we've talked and written to each other, but since you've explained the education you were brought up in I can see how this is a part of who you are, which is a wonderful thing. I would agree with you that if more public education included the studies you had at your school, we would all benefit greatly on a societal level. Do you feel your school has had an impact on the community in Albuquerque? I'm appreciative to be able to hear your point of view on many things that showcase your expanded study and contemplation on the philosophy and history you learned in school. It's beautiful that you make the effort to sprinkle in some of your teaching into the people you cross paths with. It's admirable that you take the time to do this, I think you have a gift that makes people want to listen to you and if that is what you are sharing with them you are making the world a better place for all of us.


You say you've folded to 'tests', is there anything memorable that stands out to you that you think you could have done differently? Evolution is certainly not easy. I still need to share with you a speech from one of my favorite writers, David Foster Wallace. There are plenty of recordings out there, but I want to make sure you hear a particular version of it. I would also recommend reading it after listening. That seems the best suggestion to make sure the content is retained. I know you have no issue with that, but hearing him read it audibly and then reading it for yourself seems to really segment the work in your mind. Let me know when you're up for a twenty minute or so speech. No exaggeration, I likely listen to this speech once a year as a check-in and reminder to myself. Ever since I heard this speech I have been a different person. I hope it will do you some good also.

 I know what you mean about personal evolution not being easy and painful at times, I do find though, that the process of 'evolving' gets easier. You know it's going to be uncomfortable or difficult so you are prepared for that part of it and capable of supplementing the change with perseverance. At each life junction it's not technically 'easier' or 'less painful' we are just more experienced to approach it. Do you find this the case for yourself?
That's an interesting point you bring up about people who may persecute others doing so because they are targeting a similarity. I'd like to hear more on this, do you think it is because it's something one may feel insecure or dislike about themselves and that's why they are unable to find peace with it and integrate it with love for themselves? May I ask you why you internalize when some act destructively towards others? I'm curious if this is related to your education when you were in school?


You have read 'On the Road'?! It's one of my favorite books ever. If you don't remember much it might be time for a reread, it's amazing. Everytime I pick up that book to reference a quote, (that I do often), I end up reading it cover to cover. I don't remember much from your apartment, (mostly because it was kept dark), but I wanted to ask you if you have a bookshelf? ('Library Visit': I enjoy when someone reads to me, could be another romantic idea to read a book together, reading "to" each other over the phone... or in person.)


I absolutely agree that diversity is one of the most beautiful things about our species. There's not any two of us that are exactly the same. The exchange of culture, art, philosophy, etc., seems like the formula to create an unfathomable future. There's a ton of historical references I could go on about, but that might be better for a call. It's a shame that some can be so blind to that potential. I still can't seem to understand why in the 'age of information' that prejudice still exists. We have more access to knowledge than ever and a quick reference to most anything can highlight how influence and collaboration from different backgrounds manifested most of what exists in our modern world.


'Tech savvy futuro future date'... that sounds like a lovely evening with you. I suppose I'm trying to adapt with the times and use them to bring us closer. I rarely am thankful for technology but when this happens I certainly will be. You have a computer, great! That will make things easier to navigate. You did mention Bright Eyes is playing there on October 13th. I'm taking a look at going out there to see that with you. There's something with my work I have to see about moving around but If I can, you bet I'll be there with you. I also don't want to wait that long to see you again. This was something I've reserved to bring up because I didn't want to make you feel any kind of way about it and to focus on yourself. I suppose it's my way of saying, "what's important to you, is important to me". I just wanted to give you time to make the changes you wanted for yourself so you don't feel you need to accommodate or anything like that. I'm well aware that since you have some life changes coming up that you will likely be unable to travel for a bit, I figured I would come back to see you there, that's no issue for me at all. I ask you about traveling to other cities and such, because I enjoy doing that, and if you were interested and the timing works for you I would love to include you in those plans. One thing at a time though, I'll come to see you in your city until things aren't so in flux for you.


There's three of you, noted. Do any of your other siblings have 'zwee!', does it run in the family? What about your mother? You've mentioned your mom a few times which is why I asked to know more about her and your relationship. It does seem she is a significant person in your life. I'm sorry to hear you had to grow up fast. I had a similar experience where I don't really remember being a kid at all. The things that happened to me when I was young probably shattered that innocence and the world opened up to me. From then on I can remember always feeling like the people around me were unaware of things that I could think or feel for most of my youth. Anyway, maybe another one of those 'library time phone call' subjects. I'm happy to hear that you are recognizing and working on those pressures you experienced growing up. That shows awareness, most won't even know they are dealing with anything and if they do, they may just choose to accept the default programming and not make any effort to change.


The fact that my mother has only cried three times makes me sad sometimes. I don't know if it's that she is just that tough and able to suffer relentlessly. Or she felt everything and was unable to give herself those moments because she had a tremendous amount of responsibility raising all of us. I want to point out that I 'can' cry. It's just hard. I've been misunderstood as emotionless at times, I feel sadness (mentioned above) just like most people, but I think I reserve tears for a particular type of heart broken emotions. Someone has truly violated my love to get to that level. The rest of it seems to exist on a spectrum that doesn't reach that depth.
Growing up with four brothers in an all boy household was truly insane. Especially when we were becoming men and everyone was starting to surge with testosterone. It was crazy. I can't even begin to tell you how my mother made it work raising all five of us. When I tell people I have four brothers, I get the same reaction you gave. It is more wild than most can imagine.

I let you past my guards because I felt that you were doing the same when we had dinner. I could 'see' you and If you would share that with me, having only met me briefly a day or so before, I wanted to give that some vulnerability. That way you felt that we were on the same level, that I was taking the same chance on you. Thinking back on the night we met, I was also sad that maybe I had missed you too. I told you that I went 'looking' for you. Which may not have been the most advisable action, considering the environment, but It felt right at the time and I had heard you were looking for me so I did what I could. After we left the club, I asked my friend if he thought you giving me your number was just you being nice. He said, "I don't know, but text and find out". I've told you why I waited a day. I didn't want you to get the wrong impression about me, and now we're here. I am so happy the universe gifted us the opportunity to meet and enjoy each other in that window it did. It leaves so much to explore, but I am grateful just the same.


That's gotta be so frustrating that the men in the club act like that. Arguing/debating, wouldn't they like to just want to show up and relax and have a good time - why is there always some point to prove? And mistreating the girls at the club?! Act like a gentleman. I know I have some old school sensibilities, but you all are at work and should be treated with respect. Yea, you are doing a pseudo-sexual acts, but you are literally sharing your body with the customer, that should be acknowledge and cared for. You are so right that women are the sacred portals to life, you have to say 'yes' and consent to allow us to approach that. Without you, none of us would even exist. I agree with you that 'alpha male' concept is a bunch of bullshit. It's been my observation that if you have to let others know your 'status' and that you are at the 'top', you're actually insecure, worshiping some false sense of power, and overcompensating. I meet plenty of humble people in the gym who could kill most walking on the street and they are the most quiet and kind people. You would never suspect they could commit such violence. Wouldn't it be a better world if we did stop caring about labels and focus on being kind to one another? It's that ego, it poisons the minds of many. I have one, I'm sure you do, just like everyone, but I (and I think you as well) make the choice to strip it down and actively work on checking it to remind ourselves to stay humble and engaged in kindness with one another. That's unfortunate it's affecting the clubs. You all deserve better than that.People (I assume men) need to relax and realize it's not all about being the best in the room, just be the best version of yourself and be nice to the people around you.


Whether they didn't know what they were doing, or they didn't know who they were doing it to. You didn't and you don't deserve to be mistreated at all, no exceptions. I know we mention how we are both grateful to have crossed paths at the place we're both at now, but I do wonder what could have been if we met earlier. It seems we are both the type to commit to making adjustments that would be needed to make things work if necessary. Do you think we could have grown independently and grown together before where we are now? There are a lot of "what-ifs" in that statement, but I suppose what I mean is that some part of me wishes I had met you earlier when I was younger so I could have kept you from that mistreatment. I may not have been the way I am now but I know I could have been good to you regardless. I feel the same, I would love to treat you the way you deserve to be treated.


I love when you write your cute little noises, ("Eeep!", amongst many others), I can hear them in my head when I read them. That is something I am so fond of in you. I adore the little things that make you who you are. I look forward to playing guitar for you and maybe one day playing guitar with you, if you ever feel inspired to write something together.


"All About Love", sounds like it changed your life in a lot of ways. I have a lot of respect for you setting that boundary of wanting someone to read a piece of literature that you deem so impactful to your life. That is a good way to discern who is serious about taking things to a certain level with you. That being said, If the offer still stands, I'd like to borrow your copy.. or you can read it to me! I actually love that. I will say I'm not a big fan of audio books. I can do podcasts fine, but something about not being able to pick-up/set-down the audio'book' messes with my experience. I need to investigate it a lot more to figure out why, but I know I don't like it.


The fact that you could feel my scars the night we went to dinner is incredibly perceptive of you. What was it that gave you that impression? I know I was lowering my guards, but I did not know they were so visible, maybe it's been some time since I've let someone that far in, so I forget what they can see. I appreciate you not being scared that I'm some kind of 'perpetual sad boy' or 'damaged', it's just the cards I drew in this life. I could have been that way for sure,or any number of ways really, but I wanted to be better than that, I wanted to be happy with myself and with someone else. I figured I would tell you that part about me hating myself much later, if at all. Not that I would ever hide anything but there are some things that I reserve just for me to know, but maybe it's the way you've been sharing about the things that you are afraid to share that makes me confident to open up about these deeply personal topics.

 I want to go ahead and say that you are on a trajectory to know me in a way that even my closest friends, some family, and past lovers may not know me. I hope you do stick around for as long as you want to be here, I love you being here. That's a sweet sentiment that you will  remind me to love myself. I can tell you that I plan to love myself because it will make me a better person towards you. "I want to be the best version of myself, for us".


"Little Aries Ram", bumping your horns. (Did I tell you I like the rodeo?) I can be hard headed on some things too and have to take it on the chin to learn the lesson. I try to avoid that learning style these days but I still go head first into things all the time. That's an interesting duality that you are swift on some things and feel the need to slow down on other things. May I ask you what is something recently you felt took you much longer than you anticipated it would? I do find you charming and more, on many things about you.


"The worst time to learn to fight,is during a fight", that is so insightful. I've been there with partners as the relationship goes it's natural course, and always wish there would have been a way to deescalate before, during, and after. It seems that if you go into a relationship with that 'game plan' and 'aftercare plan' when that considerable disagreement occurs you are well equipped as a couple to navigate it and maybe even reach a profitable resolution.


Neuroscience and psychology seem like an excellent avenue for you. I was saying on our recent call, when it set in how incredibly intelligent you are, and I asked,"why don't you make money with your intelligence", I was wanting to suggest you maybe consider going back to school. I know you mentioned that you were thinking about it when we hung out at the pool and I took you seriously, but now it almost seems like you certainly should, having been exposed to that brain of yours. I would never want to sway someone to do something, or even offer advice on what they should do unsolicited, that's why I didn't mention it explicitly on the phone. You should live your life the way you want, according to what you want to do and what makes sense to you. I understand the focus being on where to relocate to. I know you are unhappy there and I'm sorry it didn't work out how you had hoped, but this is likely leading you to somewhere spectacular that you were intended to be at. Everything in time, I'm confident it will all come together for you.


I'll admit something, that the night I met you, before it was ever suggested to go to the club, I was talking to my friend on what it would be like to live in Vegas, and was considering moving there to try it out. I agree that if we lived in the same state, and had the in person interaction, we may not have explored the deeper parts of one another. Given the nature of how things went, and how they are going, it seems that we were given an opportunity that may not have come our way if things were different than how they are. I agree that what we are doing now is so special.I've admitted to you that you are the only person I have done this with. I don't believe I've ever met someone I wanted to do this with, I mirror the sentiment that it feels once in a lifetime.


That makes sense about you not wanting to date anyone seriously so you don't feel obligated to stay local to the city. I've given up a number of opportunities for various people throughout my relationships. I don't regret my decisions, but those relationships ended terribly and makes me think if those choices would have been better than staying behind for someone. Can't change the past though, and if I made any single decision differently I may not be writing to you right now! You haven't put it in those exact words your feelings on moving but I've gathered that based on a number of things you've said. I'll be so happy for you when you make up your mind on where you want to go and you start planning. I can't wait to hear all about your excitement and inspirations. I feel the same about being 'burnt out' in big cities. This is going to continue with the country thing about me, but I want to move to a town that time forgot. I want to live somewhere where everything moves slower. It seems you may be looking for the same thing, if you find it before I do, and you're open for some company, let me know where to find you.


That hurts my heart to hear you were in such a low place even for a second that you had to think to yourself that you wish someone would come for you. When I said earlier I wish I had met you sooner, that's what I meant. I don't want to keep you from the growth you needed but I wish I could have spared you from the things you didn't need to experience. Some things are just hard and there is no lesson, those are the things I would want to protect you from. I would gladly take that away from you if I could. I think you are terrific and there should be nothing but love and kindness in your life. I'm not all powerful but if I had anything at all to do with it, I would damn sure make it happen. I want you to know that warrior's heart mentality was something I thought of when you told me about you doing what you had to do to make it work. Because you are without a doubt correct, it's not easy, it's much harder than most people who pass judgment even consider. It's not safe and you are putting so much on the line. One of my old roomate's (female) friends was an escort and I got to learn about the highs and lows of her life through the stories she would tell. Sometimes I would feel so sad because of what she had to go through. Believe me when I say I respect you a lot for doing for yourself regardless of what that required, of course I care about you and would like you to be safe. I see you now making changes for the things you want. You're amazing and I believe in you!


You have not asked me but I am familiar with fractals. I was also semi obsessively into fractals for a number of years. Until I learned about 'sacred geometry', then that took over my fascination.. Are you familiar with this?


I want to see and know as much as I can about you! I was joking on the phone that I want to write a book on you. It felt too early in knowing you to say what I really wanted to say, but I'll say it here because life is short: "I want you to be my life's work". Please don't get discouraged that I'm 'head over heels', I know that is the kind of thing you may say many years into a relationship. I find you so unique and fascinating, I just want to know everything about you. In the way a biologist may spend their whole life studying a rare species of something.

 I try to live by that principle of keeping my physical space in sync with my mind. I can feel my mind 'weighted' if my place is in disarray. I'm not OCD, but I am particular about my place. You'll show me yours if I show you mine? That can be arranged.. Let me know when you have the time.


I wanted to ask you what was the inspiration that you got into dancing, we've kind of skirted around it but with you wanting to leave I wasn't sure if it was the right time to ask the question. I'd like to apologize on behalf of those idiots who sexually harassed you at your previous jobs. I assume they were stupid men making the rest of us look bad. I don't say that to look better than my fellow man. Did I find you attractive when we met? Absolutely. Did my subconscious wander a bit? Sure. I think it's natural to consider it when you find someone attractive, but to act on it, especially without consent, is outright disrespectful and predatory. Respect for myself and others is a value of mine, if that isn't clear yet. Regardless of what you choose to do, I hope that you feel it's more stable so that you can have a peace of mind to figure out where you would like to go next.

I'm telling you now! I did check out your website, I found the video right away. I liked it because it had you in it. Yes, I watched it a few more times over the course of the week then I let it go. It's also a cool video so maybe I'm not all that stalkerish? If 'zwee!' comes in black, sign me up, I believe I can explore the darkness, madness, chaos and come out the otherside. Not my preferred style, but if I have to, I'll wrangle it in.


Hopefully you already feel special at this point, but no I've never had a connection with someone besides you that I felt as though I knew them from another time and place. I was a little embarrassed to ask you if you thought it was possible to miss someone you don't know all that well. So I appreciate you replying to that how you did. Maybe it's more longing, for both what has been and what could be. As mentioned, I'm taking some time to explore why it is that I feel that way. If you come to any grand conclusions I'd be open to hearing your thoughts on this. As this is a new experience for me I have no frame of reference.


I can see what you've planted. I hope you continue to grow them, I'll be excited to see what becomes of them. I know a lot of what you are doing takes time, and there's no rush at all. I want to be here. You want to be here. So when you get to a point where you have plans to share I'll be so happy for you and I'll listen with everything I got. I know you are anchored to Vegas for a while. You are not Vegas, and Vegas is not you. You want me to see you and you live in Vegas, no issue at all. I'm there for you. I most certainly will come see you, I want to spend more time with you, I want to know you.
