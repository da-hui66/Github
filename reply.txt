This reply is overdue... I know that we talk for hours when we decide to have a phone call, so I'm certain that you know what is happening in my life up to this point, but as you mentioned in your letter to me - it is special and intimate to continue to write one another despite our regular, frenquent, and lengthy communication. Having multiple mediums to continue the process of learning eachother throught thoughtful contemplation and conversation is one thing I would like to continue to blosom throughout our time together.
