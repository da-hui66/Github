I've been to several drag shows. How I end up there, I'm not sure. Same as how I came into your club I suppose, when someone suggests something if I don’t see it causing any danger or compromising myself, I'll be a 'DAB' and give most things a chance. I've had several queer friends in my life. My older brother is gay and when I was underage, he would get me into the clubs so we could party. So, I was exposed to gay culture before I was even exposed to hetero club culture. His boyfriend when I was sixteen introduced me to Kerouac's "Dharma Bums". I still have the copy he gave me sixteen years ago. He noticed I was reading books on Buddhism at the time and asked if I had ever heard of the writer. My brother's boyfriend changed my life forever by suggesting that book. That was the story I was going to tell you about that novel, when I mentioned to bring it up on the phone, but eight hours later, must have slipped my mind with all the fun we were having. I've also had gay friends and roommates. When I tried to go to college, my roommate at the time was gay and from San Francisco. One of the coolest guys I've ever spent time with. He was the 'DABest DAB' I've ever met. You remind me of him in the way that when I think I have you figured out there's this whole other part of you that shows how limitless the depth and personality can be in an individual. Although, most rarely get close to the level someone like yourself occupies. My long term friend I told you about that was born/raised in Vegas is queer. She is currently dating men but was married to a woman when I met her. There have been a few others throughout the years. I've never cared about sexual orientation, religion, race, creed, etc., whatever anyone might be into as long as they are respectful of others at the same time. I'd absolutely be open to watching drag race or anything with you. That virtual dinner idea I had could be extended to maybe dinner and a show, where we could stream the drag race together. I agree, I bet a live drag show would be a ton of fun especially if there is live music involved. If there is a way to combine both your interest in drag and our mutual interest in music that sounds like a wonderful time.

I could tell based on some of the conversations we’ve had about past relationships and wanting to be better people, that we are both driven to make adjustments to work on ourselves. You're likely on to something regarding your theory about when two people get together like that, it being an ideal combination for a successful relationship. It calls back to the notion of two people who are committed to do the work that each of them needs to do independently to work through any conflict. I've never had that experience either, but I keep an open mind that I can still get that at some point in my life. Maybe you're right, who cares how many or which cliche you live by if it helps remind you to be a better person. They do exist for a reason, that being said, you've inspired me to keep adding to my repertoire then.

I don't know if my mother was self-sacrificing with her partners. The only one I've known has been the man she's married to now and she certainly is not that way with him whatsoever. In fact, she is very demanding of him. I think it's your other theory, that I observed the love model from her being self-sacrificing with my siblings and I. We often didn’t have anything at all and she would be first in line to go without. I watched her always make something from nothing for my brothers and I. There are still things that I don't know how she pulled off when we were in tough spots. I've always seen her put herself last, and if there was nothing left, she would just deal with it. She is the toughest person (including fighters) I have ever known. 
I would whole heartedly agree that men want to be needed. In these soft/plush modern times we live in where there is no need for men to rise to the demands that were placed on our ancestors, it creates this void in our genetic wiring, and you are correct many don’t adapt. I think more men should challenge themselves to do stressful/uncomfortable things to not allow themselves to become complacent and docile. Not to encourage that 'alpha male culture', but to make men who can provide when the occasion is called for. "I’d rather be a warrior in a garden, than a gardener in a war". The best advice I got before was "do things that scare you, growth is uncomfortable". I know you're right about wanting to be a protector/provider. I can tell by the way I am with my mother, brothers, and lovers. What I must give, I gave to the wrong people. Or maybe the right people to teach me the lessons I was supposed to learn. 

I agree completely that the desire to be needed can be conflated with feeling loved. I've been guilty of that myself. You are correct in both assumptions. I cared for woman who did not love themselves, and I did not love myself either. I didn’t love myself for most of my life. At times I even hated myself, a lot of people think they know hate, but hating yourself is a completely different thing all together. I was always so sad and alone in the quiet still parts of my mind that no one ever got to see. I struggled with that for a long time, then the lying and being cheated on added on in a way that I couldn’t take anymore. So, I wanted a change, a better quality of life. If I could refine so many other aspects of my life, why couldn’t I figure out how to be happy? So that I'm well equipped and well-adjusted to share that happiness with someone who deserves it? The self-preservation model as it exists today came exactly from what you mention of regenerating self-love. It was a tough climb and is always a work in progress. As I learn more about myself and others, it opens new thoughts and feelings to explore but the core value remains the same to protect that self-love and self-respect.

We are from the same book! You're just a few pages ahead of me. I like to take my time; don't worry I'll be right behind you and I'll be there at the end. It's true, to believe you will never disappoint anyone in any type of relationship is a fallacy. To maintain a healthy and meaningful relationship though, it’s got to be essential to work through it, adjust, and course correct for the future. I feel like we circle around the same themes over different iterations of thoughts and ideas. This is likely because they are valued so highly by each of us. Communication breakdown is the beginning of the end for most relationships from what I've lived and heard from others and watching it happen in real time is so heartbreaking. Watching the cycle of strangers to lovers and back again. I mentioned on the phone the first time we talked, if someone would have just discussed with me and helped me understand - shown me their perspective/need/desire - I could have made anything work. I'm not an unreasonable person, I can consider that two things can be true at the same time and that people make mistakes or life doesn’t always fit into nice neat little boxes. I want you to know that I wouldn't ask you to promise not to disappoint me. I wouldn't ask you to be perfect. I would only ask that you do the best you can with what you have at the time. I'll make my best effort to keep open communication with you also. This is new to me for the same reason that I've never experienced anything like this before either. Unless something happens to me or you tell me to go away for good, there really will never be a loss here. You didn't make any promises, you don't owe me anything. There are no expectations. Sure, is there certain scenarios to this playing out that are more palatable than others? Yes. I've lived life though; I know things don’t always work out like they should. However, that doesn’t mean I'd ever miss the chance to give it all I could.

What part  of working at the club skews your moral compass? I guess what I mean is morality compared to what? We talked about how you have been on the receiving end of lies and misbehavior by the customers, is their compass pointed anymore towards a righteous direction than yours? This makes me think about our conversation on judgement and I wonder how that all comes together for you? I never stopped to think about what lying/masking does to you if you have to do it all the time. That's a fascinating question about what that might do to actors. Do you think that being guarded is a type of masking? I'm curious to know more about if your 'spaghetti at the wall' mojo is exclusive to Vegas? (Some part of me thinks that just your creativity manifesting) When you would go to Chicago for the summers and work, how would being between the two cities for the season affect your workflow? I tend to stay away from bullshit as much as I can. Naturally, it’s not completely unavoidable, but the less the better. That's what attracted me to you. I felt like I could 'see' you, as weird as that might sound. Maybe that's why I was trying to look at you so hard to determine if what I was seeing was there. You were not only 'there', but present and alive in full authenticity I felt that then, and I know that now.

I didn't think about misogyny and "whorephobia", that's just uncalled for. I always think that if you got it like that, and you're okay with that work then more power to you. Especially since you mention there wasn't any exclusivity or discussion around the topic. If you weren't on that level then there really is no reason to have any negative thoughts on the matter. Most girls that guys are sleeping with are doing it for free anyway, so why couldn’t someone get paid for it if someone else is willing to pay for it? Doesn’t that seem fairer? It seems that there was some narrow-mindedness around this, and I hope you don't let that affect your sense of self-worth. I don't hold any judgements or negative views on you for doing what you must do. I think the opposite, you went out and did for yourself with what you could and made it work. You didn't feel sorry for yourself or wait for someone to save you. That is so respectable in my book. I'll tell you that I can handle a lot, I've seen and heard a lot of things. Maybe it's something about me not opening, but people, for one reason or another tend to tell me the wildest things. Do some things make me uncomfortable, sure, I cant deny that, but If the transparency is maintained and I reach an understanding I don’t think there is much that would ever cause me to be disrespectful.

I'm so happy you've taken a liking to the mobius strip analogy. I wouldn’t have brought it up if I didn’t think it was the perfect fit. Is it overstepping to suggest that could be a tattoo idea for you? You wouldn’t think it's difficult to find black clothing with no branding. It's more complicated than is necessary, I tend to say my style is 'particularly in particular' for lack of a better definition. I didn't mean to intimidate you with the statement of getting lost in you. I assure you I can stand on my own and do for myself by myself. What I meant is, when I'm present with you and I stare into your eyes, I want to stay in that moment and let the whole world stop around us. When I'm there with you between your legs I want to feel like my soul is on fire with the same power that lights the stars.

I'm sorry to hear you've been in survival mode for that long. I know all too well what that feeling is like, so I know you must be tired. It's interesting to know your creativity comes from the 'zwee!'. I would be thrilled to know more about this. You're right that most tend to derive their creativity from depression and struggle, I am that way from time to time. I think we are experimenting creatively already, between exchanging thoughts, ideas, and emotions. Expressing in different ways to one another. The way we are messaging (now writing) to one another feels like dancing. It's more than just sharing, there's this other element present, that I'd need to let develop some more to be able to elaborate on.

I can tell you that girls do not throw themselves at me. I've had stuff thrown at me but not women. I did make excuses to touch you, I also wanted to be reserved in that so you didn’t feel that I was trying to make a move on you. I wasn't sure how to read you and I figured you might have had guys come onto you like that regularly and I wanted to be respectful and only come when invited. I think I could tell that you were guarded a bit, as I've mentioned 'it takes one to know one'. I tried my best to not let my guard down but the more the night went on the less I cared to. It seemed you were just going to be yourself fully and that encouraged me to let go and be present just the same. I am as real as you'll let me be. I prefer to be sweet and sensitive; most people don't really get to experience that. Not that I'm mean or disrespectful, but I do not let people mistake my kindness for weakness. 

Please always feel like you can express any and all anxiety to me. Whether it's about me or otherwise. I don't mind listening at whatsoever and I'll make time to remind you about the pendulum and how it's all going to be okay. I too replay moments from our time together that are precious to me. There is a Bright Eyes song about making plans, I won’t spoil the discovery and let you come to it all on your own, and when you do I'll be excited to know you found it.
