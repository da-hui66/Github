That is such a beautiful statement you mentioned about how we are "more alike than different". This is something I think about regularly, and wish that collectively we would consider it more often, and when we cannot find a compromise or commonality, then just agree to disagree. I don't feel that everything needs to be so argumentative, aggressive, or final. How many lives could have been saved throughout the course of human history if we had considered this higher level of thinking. Of course it's easier said than done most days, and somedays I think we just don’t want to put in the effort to make the more evolved choice. 
It's great that you set the standard for the people who you keep in your life to have an open mind and general respect for others. It's hard to be accepting of 'everyone', there are people with warped opinions, and sometimes it's hard not to condemn or even consider their perspective, but often people are just trying to live their lives the way they want and enjoy it. Nothing wrong with that, and if you have a problem with that, it's not your life so what does it matter to you? It doesn’t affect you. I've seen some get so worked up over another's lifestyle choices, affiliations, preferences, etc., when it has nothing to do with them whatsoever. I find that wasteful of one's time and mental/emotional 'currency' and I try my best to avoid people like that.
I’ve always tended to surround myself with the people who don’t fit in anywhere else or are special in their own way. I find interesting people fun to be around. They tend to enjoy themselves more and move 'fluidly' through life. I always feel 'stuffy' if I'm surrounded by carbon copies of the same style of person. If you ever read "On the Road" (Kerouac) there is this one quote that I've always loved from that novel: "..the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes 'Awww!'.. " I don’t know which came first, whether I entered the orbit of those kind of personalities and then read the quote. Or read the quote and noticed it was applicable for my life. Either way, I tend to think that we exist on frequencies where similar types tend to gravitate towards each other throughout life. After spending time with people, they tend to open and tell me things that they might feel judged for being different, I always make the effort to assure them "it takes one to know one", and "why do you think we get along so well?". I've met a lot of characters in my travels through this life. From my experiences there seems to be this correlation, that the more diverse people are, the more passionate and understanding they are of others. It seems they have this freedom to dare to be themselves fully and this opens a type of self-love that exudes and spreads to the people close to them. It feels so good to be around people like that. That's what I felt when I was with you, I felt so happy and warm in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. I can feel that when I think through what I am going to write in response to you, and I feel that while I listen on the phone to you tell me all about your life and experiences. 
I have some stories about my old roommate from San Francisco that I'll share with you next time we chat on the phone. His name is 'Glenny' for reference. I also have some stories queued up about my friend from Vegas. She has lived many lives without a doubt. She is a tough woman, been through some stuff and another inspiration in my life. Her name is 'Brittany'. 

I got you on the dinner/and more night. I set up stuff like this all the time at my IT job. It's mostly figured out in my head. I need to confirm if you have a computer. (if not that's okay, I can figure it out). Let me know if you ever get inspired to travel to an event somewhere or if you'd like company to something local to you. I travel all the time to go to concerts. If I want to see an artist on tour, they are playing in a city I've never been to, and I can make it work, I'll go see the music and explore something new at the same time. I started doing this at the start of this year and I fell in love with it. It's an incredibly enriching experience. 
I'd be curious to hear more about your mother based on experiences you had growing up that are like mine, and how those contributed to the way you have shown up in relationships. I know we've talked about each other’s siblings before. Can you remind me of how many and where you are in the line up within your family? Not having any sisters I'd need to ask you to provide clarification on what you mean by "older sister syndrome". My mother is an extremely strong-willed woman, I can tell you I've never seen weakness in her one time and I’ve only seen her cry three times in my life. She is five feet tall and about 120ish pounds so physically she can't do that much, especially now that she is getting older. I guess that's why the universe decided she needed five boys in her life.  I'll tell you though, despite her age and stature she can have more output and run circles around most people my age and younger. The honor is mine to share her narrative with you. I tend to keep my personal life to myself until I feel that someone 'deserves' it. I suppose that's my way of saying I'm sharing things with you that I don’t with most of the people that have come into my life, and it feels fantastic to share with you for a number of reasons, but surely it means that I feel some kind of way about you. People have gone years without knowing these things and it looks like you were chauffeured right up to the front of the line. I could tell from the moment I met you that you were an exception.
How is the 'alpha male culture' and 'red pill' influencing the club's environment? I agree there are a lot of younger men who are looking for something and they are blindly following these 'male role models' who use flash and flare that are attractive to a young man, who doesn’t have the life experience to contemplate what they are being exposed to and make an informed decision. 
I love that reframe so much, "life is happening for me, not to me". Your optimism continues to shine. You are positive and lighthearted, and it is an amazing look on you. Having heard of the ways people have been less than kind to you, it seems like such a tragedy that anyone would dare to disturb such a wonderfully expressive soul like yours. People like you deserve to be cherished. You deserve so much more than I can even put into words. I guess that's why I'll get my guitar and tell you that way someday. 
I have not read the book "All About Love", but if it changed your life significantly, I'm certainly going to give it a read. Do you think it would have the same effect if you didn't read it at a period of change after the break up? Or is the book undeniably able to offer important lessons inside a relationship or not? It hurt my heart too to hate myself. It likely left some scars there. That's something I have admitted to one other person besides you. I'm afraid potential partners will see that as 'baggage', but I see it as a type of growth that most people will never have. The self love that came out of knowing, wanting, and doing what was required to change what I was feeling made such a difference in how I'm able to treat and love others. I'm equally joyous that we met when we did you get to experience THIS version of me. Not that the others were less, just not as adjusted. This version is far from perfect, but the best I have for now. If you stick around, I'm sure you'll see it become even better in time. Did I mention I don't like to be complacent? Not that I don't, "know how to chill". It's more that I want to be better, do better, live better. Especially towards the people who are important in my life.
What makes me think you are pages ahead of me? I feel that you are bouncy, light, and move quickly. I can when I must or need to, but I tend to take my time with a lot of things. I want to be confident and sure it's the right thing. Please don't take it as me saying anything any kind of way about you. I think it’s adorable how I perceive you. You seem full of energy in the way you speak and express yourself. I have that monotone, low, and slow drawl. It's like you're the Tigger to my Eeyore.
That's an incredible insight to have about conflict resolution! I haven't checked out the podcast yet, but I am going to this weekend. I'm excited to learn more about this 'game plan' protocol. In the simple summary you've mentioned in your message it sounds like an amazingly useful tool. I've never been much for arguing. I feel it wastes time and emotional energy. I've had people want that interaction from me and try to push me into it, but they end up pushing me into a place that is much more uncomfortable. This is due to my nature that I don't really engage until my 'back is against the wall'. "Aftercare" plan?! That's a great idea! With your ability to learn and observe, have you ever considered being a therapist? I think you would be unbelievable at it. I've never seen a more perfect fit. I don’t want to put you into a box by that statement but there have been several things you've either said on the phone or mentioned in your writing that made me think that.
I'm sorry you had to live through that with your ex. That wasn't fair to you at all. You would have hoped that things were going to be different just to be crushed later that they were still the same or worse. I've been there before and know what it feels like. I hope you aren't still beating yourself up for staying while you did. Hindsight is a different perspective; you couldn't have known what you know now without having gone through it. Not to diminish what you went through, you deserved to be treated with respect and had the promises that were made to you kept.
I can feel through your writing that you are intentional and thorough in what you express in your messages, and my hope is that you can feel the same in return. I suppose I'm not able to make any promises because of how things are between us. I understand you are in a transitional period in your life, and I want to be respectful of that. I was a tourist and anything I would have wanted to say at the time might have come across as 'phony' and I wouldn't want that with you whatsoever. It felt a certain way when we spent time together, I think we both can admit that, but I figured if there was something here, we could just see what happens and accept what becomes of it without expectations. You are correct in your assumption; I don't want to make promises I cannot keep. One of my values is stick to my word and honor the commitments I make.
It's easy to see how working in that environment, especially in Vegas, can alter perspectives. I said it when I left, that there is something about that city, that if you don't have the conviction for self-control then Vegas can take your soul. I think that might be applicable for tourists and locals alike. The way you've talked about your time in Chicago and how you compare it to Vegas, I could gather that you were at home in Chicago. I wanted to ask you why you haven't gone back since you seem to have not enjoyed your time after your move, but your answer about the weather settles part of it. Sometimes the most profound lessons are the hardest to get through, but you seem like you are taking it well and will be much better for it in the long run. I mean it when I say that a person like you does not fail only gets derailed.

I hope you don’t take, "waiting for someone to save me" as me thinking you are incapable. I know you are more than capable. We just live in a world where people think they are owed things they haven’t worked for. I've worked for everything in my entire life, I know it's far from easy. I know there is struggle, fatigue, uncertainty, but when you get to the other side of it all you have so much more "wealth" in experience and understanding. I know hard times aren't hard to find. I've been there, but there are people who just give up and don't make any effort whatsoever when it's more than difficult. I'm from the camp that I want to get to where I'm going or I'm going to die trying. That's why I find it surprising that someone would even begin to criticize you for doing what you needed to do to make it work. You weren't taking the easy way out, you put in effort just like everyone else, it was just a different effort. I find that commendable and I have a high level of respect for you. I want you to know that you can always tell me anything and if I feel uncomfortable, I'll tell you. If I need a better understanding, I'll ask you. I can tell you that I tend to keep most things as easy as possible to save energy for the hard stuff in life. I'm not perfect but I'll always give you my best.

You've already investigated the mobius strip tattoo?! That's amazing! I typically don't even bother explaining that concept to most people because I think their minds can’t/won’t comprehend. After that first phone call, I told myself, “The next time I talk to her I need to ask her if she knows what this is, and if she doesn’t, I’ll introduce the concept, because it is a perfect fit". You want to see my closet? It's mostly empty, say for nothing but black clothing, just multiple pieces of the same article of clothing because hygiene. I'm a minimalist at heart. The way I keep my mind is the way I like to keep my house empty and open for potential. I'll trade you a view into how I live for a view into how you live. I got to come to your house, but I couldn’t see much in my short time with you. I'd love to know more. 
That's a great point about thriving being a dynamic state of existence. This would also support your adherence to the pendulum principal. I'm comforted to know that you have never given up on the idea of reaching a thriving state. I believe you deserve to feel safe and comfortable in all the ways that make sense to you. You mention 'clocking in' at a straightforward job again... What does that look like to you? It's been my experience since I was a teenager, with your alternate perspectives I'd like to hear the comparison from your view. 
I did look at your website, the first day you sent it, and truthfully, I've watched that video about six or seven times since you're in it.'Zwee!' looks perfect on you. It seems you live your life exactly how you need to based on what I've seen.  I'm not sure I can wrap my head around it fully just yet, but I suppose with enough time and exposure I think I could get onboard. Does 'zwee!' ever come in black? I've been wondering if it is possible to miss someone you do not fully know, but that you feel a connection with in a particular way. I believe we've agreed that there seems to be a synchronicity between us from another time and space that brought us into each other's gravity. I have to explore all this; it will be a multi-day journaling topic. I doubt there can be any definitive conclusions in a single session on this.

I do remember you touching my leg, right after you said you couldn't hear me, and you scooted over. I wasn't expecting it for sure. I also used my low register to get close to your face by suggesting I might need to switch to talking in your ear. I wasn't going to cross any lines, but I wanted to let you know subtly that I was interested in you by getting closer as well.
I plan to show up in whatever capacity is required to nurture this relationship in whatever way it turns out. I want you to feel safe and respected. I want you to know that I'll be sensitive, kind, and understanding. There's no pressure here to be anything at all or do anything at all. You're great and I'm just as thankful that you continue to show up in your capacity as well. When you're ready to share your plan, I'll be excited to hear it and greet you with that long hug and a kiss.
